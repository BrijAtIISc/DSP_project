Market experts anticipate large-cap stocks to lead gains in Q3 and Q4 as sector-specific opportunities unfold.\n\nTime correction is anticipated for stocks in Q3 and Q4, with large-cap stocks expected to strengthen first in the upcoming quarters, according to Deven Choksey, Managing Director at DRChoksey Investment Managers. \u201cBoth these quarters will involve some amount of time correction, and within that, largecaps will likely start strengthening and gradually rising,\u201d Choksey told NDTV Profit.\n\nThe current high-interest rate environment is expected to ease, which could boost corporate confidence and stimulate demand as government infrastructure spending ramps up, he said.\n\nAbhay Agarwal, founder and MD of Piper Serica Advisors, maintains a cautious short-term outlook due to the cyclical downturn, suggesting that earnings projections may need downward adjustments.\n\n\u201cGiven the cyclical slowdown, it\u2019s hard to see what will drive the Nifty index over the next 6-12 months,\u201d Agarwal told NDTV Profit. However, he remains bullish on India\u2019s long-term potential, noting that new listings in high-growth sectors are emerging as attractive opportunities.\n\nChoksey echoed this optimism for the medium to long term, especially in sectors like insurance, health, pharma, and metals, where he sees substantial growth potential. \u201cWe\u2019re very bullish on insurance, health, and pharma, with metals also looking promising,\u201d he noted.\n\n\"Remain cautious around high-valuation stocks, which could underperform, and in the IT sector,\" he said. Choksey prefers engineering R&D companies over frontline IT firms.\n\n\u201cThe broader market holds exciting opportunities, with several newly listed companies that could become multi-baggers,\u201d Agarwal advised.\n\nIn the commodities space, Choksey sees metals as a strong opportunity over the next 3-6 months. Within pharma, he highlights the appeal of the CDMO and API businesses, while advising caution on expensive stocks due to potential long-term underperformance.",

Analysts expect pressure to continue with the charts indicating further downside.\n\nAfter trading within a range for the past couple of weeks, prices have broken out to the downside, confirming a lower top-lower-bottom structure on the daily chart.\n\nThis also broke the critical neckline of the head and shoulder pattern, which indicate a reversal from the bullish momentum. This comes as the October sell-off is mirroring the rise seen in September, according to Rajesh Bhosale, Equity Technical Analyst, Angel One.\n\nHe also added that prices have slipped below the 89 DEMA for the first time since June.\n\nThe key support for Nifty 50 will be at 24,200, where a bullish gap was left in August, with immediate support at 24,300, said Bhosale. While resistance would be at 24,650-24700.\n\nShrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities, indicated that if the market is trading below the support levels, the index could fall to 24,250 levels, while on the upside it could touch 24,700 levels.\n\nBank Nifty that was holding on till yesterday also saw a breakdown amid selling pressure. The support for Bank Nifty is placed at 51,000 below which the index could fall to 50,200 levels, said Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. He also added that on the upside, 51,800-51,900 could act as an immediate hurdle for Bank Nifty.\n\n\"A sustained break below 51,000 could trigger further downside momentum, potentially leading to a more pronounced decline in Bank Nifty,\u201d added Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C.

The volatility index, India VIX, rose 4.74% to 14.63, indicating increased market volatility.\n\n\"Technically, Nifty formed a bearish candle on both daily and weekly charts, indicating weakness.

He suggested a sell-on-rise strategy while also recommending caution in this volatile environment.\n\nBank Nifty opened with a huge gap up but, post the initial shoot-up, it saw profit booking and closed lower at 51,963. Despite the bearish candle on the daily chart, Bank Nifty managed to close above the 21-Day Exponential Moving Average support, which is placed at 51,915, said Hrishikesh Yedve, assistant vice president of technical and derivatives research at Asit C. Mehta Investment Intermediates Ltd.\n\n\"Inability to sustain at higher levels shows lack of strength and hence there is likely to be further consolidation before any meaningful upside. On the upside, 52,250\u201352,300 shall act as an immediate hurdle zone while 51,100\u201351,000 shall act as a crucial support zone,\" said Jatin Gedia, technical research analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.",

He advised caution and was waiting for a trend reversal.\n\nThe GIFT Nifty was up 0.27%, or 65 points at 24,192.50 as of 6:56 a.m.",

Dot plot of Fed officials' commentary now expects to lower rates by one percentage point by year-end.\n\nOn the downside, 25,280\u201325,300 serves as an immediate support base for Nifty, followed by the 21-double exponential moving average support, which is placed near 25,080 levels, said Hrishikesh Yedve, assistant vice president of technical and derivatives research at Asit C. Mehta Investment Intermediates Ltd.\n\nAs long as Nifty stays above 25,080, a buy-on-dips strategy is advisable, with the potential for the index to test 25,600 in the short term, he added.\n\nAccording to Yedve, the index formed a \"spinning top candle\" on a daily scale near its all-time high, signalling some short-term hesitation. \"Therefore, on the upside, 25,500 will act as an immediate hurdle for Nifty.\"\n\nIf the index sustains above 25,500, it could test the 25,600 levels, he added.\n\nThe equity market may witness profit booking if the Fed slashes the lending rate by only 25 basis points, said Siddhartha Khemka, head of research in wealth management at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. The rate cut announcement by the Fed is scheduled later on Wednesday.\n\n\"However, a 50 bps rate cut by the Fed could bring some cheer to market sentiments. Also, Fed commentary will be important as it will give clarity on the quantum and duration of the rate cut cycle,\" he said.",

Nifty's six-day losing streak continues amid growing concerns over the geopolitical tension and a shift in foreign investor sentiment, which has reduced India\u2019s weight in favour of China.\n\n\"The bulls have taken the back seat as Nifty continued to plunge lower for the sixth consecutive session and plummeted below the 50-day exponential moving average (DEMA) on the daily chart. Our domestic market sentiments have turned sceptical, with the index cooling down over 5% from its peak,\" according to Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst, Technical & Derivatives, Angel One Ltd.\n\nKrishan further explained that Nifty is now positioned in a critical zone that has historically served as strong support. \"A decisive breakdown below the 24,800 zone is likely to disrupt the short-term chart structure, potentially leading to further corrections. On the lower end, 24,700 is expected to provide immediate support, with a stronger support level around 24,500. On the upside, resistance levels range from 25,000\u201325,100 to 25,200\u201325,300,\" Krishan said.\n\nAdding to the market's anxiety, the volatility index, INDIA VIX, surged by 6.74%, settling at 15.08. This jump indicates increased market volatility, according to Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C. Mehta Investment Intermediates Ltd.\n\n\"Technically, on the daily chart, the index formed a red candle, signalling weakness. However, it managed to defend the 24,750 level, providing some relief for the bulls. As long as the index holds within the 24,700\u201324,750 range, a short-term pullback could be possible. However, if Nifty sustains below 24,700, we could see deeper declines,\" Yedve added.\n\nBank Nifty, which closed on a negative note at 50,479 on Monday, will face immediate resistance near the 51,000\u201351,100 levels on the upside, according to Yedve. \"On the downside, the psychological level of 50,000 will act as important support, followed by 49,650,\" he stated.\n\n\"Going ahead, it is crucial to exercise extreme caution as such correction has taken place after a long haul, and rushing for bottom fishing should certainly be avoided. It is advisable to take one step at a time as the week is going to be eventful, with the MPC meeting followed by the commencement of quarterly earnings,\" Krishnan said.",

The index closed with a loss of 66 points at 24,415 on Wednesday, experiencing post-budget impact and trading in negative territory throughout the session.\n\n\"We expect the market to consolidate in the near term,\" said Siddhartha Khemka, head of retail research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. \"The market is expected to swiftly move past the budget and refocus on corporate earnings growth. So far in Q1 FY25, earnings growth has been slightly below expectations,\" said Khemka.\n\nThis seems to be a time-wise correction for the index, as the broader markets have been doing well, while the RSI oscillator on the benchmark is hinting at a continuation of the corrective phase, according to Ruchit Jain, lead researcher at 5paisa.com.\n\n\"Traders are advised to trade with a stock-specific approach for the near term.

However, if the markets fall below this level, they may retest the level of 24,750-24,650, he added.\n\nThe current technical trend suggests a \"sell on rise\" strategy, with fresh buying opportunities likely to emerge only if the Nifty decisively moves above the 25,500 zone, according to Mandar Bhojane, Technical Research Analyst, Choice Broking.\n\nThe Bank Nifty, which saw a 4% correction last week, will see 51,500 act as a key support zone.

He anticipates that Nifty may test the 50-day EMA support in the 24,040\u201324,000 range and could potentially dip below the recent low of 23,900.\n\n\"With the upcoming weekly expiry for both Nifty and Bank Nifty, increased volatility is expected. Traders should avoid complacency, keep positions light, and prepare for potential market fluctuations ahead of the mid-week holiday,\" Bhosale said. \"Conversely, the 24,350\u201324,500 range remains a critical hurdle; only a breach beyond this range would likely favour bullish momentum,\" he said.\n\nBank Nifty witnessed a sharp bounce from its support of 50,200 levels and closed flat to positive, driven by momentum in private banks.\n\n\"The first band of resistance (for Bank Nifty) is at 51,300 levels, which is the band of averages for an upward breakout; the trend reversal is placed at 49,800 levels.

        "text": "Trade Setup For Aug. 6: Nifty 50 Falls Below Budget-Day Low, Analysts Predict Continued Volatility\nThe Nifty 50 dipped below its budget-day low, while Indian benchmarks closed at their lowest point in over a month. This decline aligns with global equity markets, which were unsettled by growing concerns over a potential US recession and escalating tensions in the Middle East, causing investor apprehension.\n\nNifty opened with a significant gap-down and corrected by more than 800 points during the day, ultimately closing with a loss of 662 points (-2.7%) at 24,056 levels. The volatility index, India VIX, surged by 42% to 20 levels, reflecting investor fears of an economic slowdown.\n\n\"Going forward, we expect volatility to continue ahead of RBI policy announcements and multiple global headwinds, including the unwinding of Yen carry trades, recession fears in the US, and escalating tensions in the Middle East. The US slowdown is a bigger concern, and sooner or later, the US Fed will bite the bullet of interest rate cuts, which should provide relief in the current environment,\" said Siddhartha Khemka, head of retail research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.\n\n\"Further, the valuation for Nifty is comfortable near its 10-year average at 21 times one-year forward P/E. Hence, we believe that any correction in Indian equities should be an opportunity for long-term investors to accumulate good-quality stocks,\" Khemka said.\n\n\"Technically, the index witnessed heavy selling pressure after forming a spinning top pattern and ending with a red candle. A strong break below 24,000 will likely trigger further selling pressure in the index. On the downside, 23,300 and 23,000 will provide significant support for the Nifty in the immediate term,\" said Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediates Ltd.\n\nThe Bank Nifty index also opened on a negative note, remained under pressure throughout the day, and settled negatively at 50,092. \"Technically, the index has broken the short-term swing support at 50,438 and continued forming lower highs and lower lows, indicating weakness. On the upside, 50,400\u201350,500 will act as an immediate hurdle for the Bank Nifty, while 49,500 and 49,000 will provide short-term support for the index,\" Yedve said.\n\nAs of 6:42 am, the GIFT Nifty is trading 1.01%, or 242.5 points, higher at 24,364.5.",

Traders await to see whether the AI-induced euphoria has run its course or if the bull market has any sustenance left. The Indian market is expected to take cues from how Wall Street performs on Wednesday, given the massive influence that Nvidia has on broader indexes.\n\nAnalysts caution that a failure to break this resistance may trigger short-term consolidation or profit-taking, as indicated by the spinning top candlestick pattern. Traders might consider booking profits if the index remains below this level, said Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP technical and derivatives research of Asit C. Mehta Investment Intermediates. On the other hand, a sustained move above 25,130 could reignite the rally towards 25,300\u201325,500, with immediate support seen near the 24,820 mark.\n\nThe Nifty's recent performance shows signs of losing momentum, as shown by a long-legged doji candlestick pattern and a potential bearish divergence in the relative strength index, according to Aditya Gaggar, director of Progressive Share Brokers. \"A break below 24,970 could see the index sliding further to 24,840, while on the flip side, a firm close with a bullish candle above 25,100 is a must to continue its northward journey,\" he said.\n\nDespite reaching new all-time highs on Wednesday, the Nifty failed to sustain its gains and closed near its opening range, signalling indecision in the market, according to Avdhut Bagkar, technical and derivatives analyst of StoxBox.\n\nHowever, profit-booking in the late trading session suggests caution. Nifty's struggle to maintain its upward momentum comes amid weak global sentiments, said Hashim Yacoobali, director of South Gujarat Shares and Sharebrokers. Investors should brace for potential volatility as the index tests these critical levels, he warned.\n\nThe GIFT Nifty, an early indicator of the Nifty 50\u2019s performance in India, was up 27.5 points or 0.11% at 25,005.5 as of 6:38 a.m.",

However, the peak out in VIX suggests some stability and support-based buying at lower zones, according to Chandan Taparia, senior vice president of equity derivatives & technical at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.\n\nThe GIFT Nifty, an early indicator of the Nifty 50 Index\u2019s performance in India, was up 22.5 or 0.09% at 24,349 as of 06:44 a.m.",

While the Nifty experienced a relief rally today, volatility cannot be ruled out,\" said Siddhartha Khemka, head of retail research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.\n\nThe upcoming RBI policy outcome on Thursday will be closely watched, with expectations of maintaining the interest rate.

        "text": "Trade Setup For June 25: Analysts Signal Bullish Momentum For Nifty\nThe momentum equity gauges at the current levels are indicating a bullish setup, with Nifty taking support from a rising trendline and maintaining a positive primary trend, according to market analysts.\n\nThe daily chart shows a bullish candle for the Nifty 50, and the immediate support is at 23,300. A pullback to 23,450\u201323,400 presents a buying opportunity for the next session, according to Samco Securities.\n\nThe Bank Nifty would need a decisive breach above the 52,000 zone to establish conviction and thereafter anticipate further rises. The support would be near 50,700 levels of the trendline zone for the bias to be maintained positively, according to Vaishali Parekh, vice president of technical research at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt.\n\nThe larger market texture is still non-directional; hence, level-based trading would be the ideal strategy for day traders, Kotak Securities Pvt. said in a note.\n\nMoreover, markets this week will take cues from global macro data points and the progress of the monsoon back home. The Nifty is expected to consolidate at the current juncture with a bout of volatility amid the expiry of the expiry of monthly derivatives, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. said.\n\nThe GIFT Nifty, an early indicator of the Nifty 50 Index\u2019s performance in India, was down 20 or 0.08% at 23,572 as of 06:41 a.m.",

Leading the gains were the Nifty Metal, IT, Realty, and Healthcare sectors, while the Nifty Private Bank and FMCG sectors lagged.\n\n\"For the trend following traders now, 24,675-24,600/80,900-80,600 would act as a key support zone. On the higher side, 25,000/81,600 could be the immediate hurdle for the bulls,\" according to Amol Athawale, VP-Technical Research, Kotak Securities.\n\n\"We are of the view that the short-term market texture is bullish, but due to temporary overbought conditions, we could see range-bound activity in the near future,\" he said.\n\n\"Further upside may also continue, which could lift the market up to 25,150/82,200. On the flip side, below 24,600/80,600, the sentiment could change. Below the same, traders may prefer to exit from trading long positions,\" he cautioned traders.\n\nTechnically, the index formed a significant bullish candle on both the daily and weekly scales, indicating underlying strength, according to Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP of technical and derivatives research at Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediates Ltd. \"If the index sustains above 24,860, it may attempt to test the psychological level of 25,000,\" he said.\n\nThe Bank Nifty index closed positively at 51,296 levels.\n\n\"For Bank Nifty traders, now, the 50-day SMA or 50,500 would be the immediate reference point. Above which, it could bounce back up to 51,800\u201352,100. However, below 50,500 or 50-day SMA, it could slip to 50,000\u201349,900,\" said Athawale.\n\n\"On a daily scale, the index formed a bullish belt hold pattern and successfully maintained above 51,100 on a weekly basis, signalling strength. In the short term, 51,800\u201352,000 will serve as resistance levels for the Bank Nifty,\" said Yedve.",

The rally was driven by heavyweights HDFC Bank Ltd. and ICICI Bank Ltd.\n\nThe benchmark index's rise above 24,300 represents a shift in sentiment towards long trades in the market, according to Rupak De, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities. The momentum might remain strong in the near term as long as it stays above 24,000, he said.\n\nOn the higher end, the index might move towards 24,500. However, a fall below 24,000 could lead the index into consolidation, he said.\n\nThe Bank Nifty index witnessed strong momentum and surpassed the hurdle of 53,000 on a closing basis. \"The immediate support now stands at 52,500, and a dip towards this support would be an ideal opportunity to initiate fresh long positions,\" said Kunal Shah, senior technical and derivative analyst at LKP Securities.\n\nThe bullish trend in the banking sector will continue to be led by the heavyweights, according to Ruchit Jain, lead research analyst at 5Paisa Ltd. \"Private sector banks and many information technology companies have recovered from lower levels.\"\n\nWith the drop in Indian banks' gross non-performing assets to a 12-year low, the sector is anticipated to outperform in the near-term, according to Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services.\n\nThe GIFT Nifty was trading 13.5 points, or 0.06%, lower at 24,457 as of 06:52 a.m.",

The short-term market outlook remains non-directional, analysts said, with range-bound activity expected to persist in the near future.\n\nAnalysts advise caution, since a breach of key support levels could lead to further downside in the near future.\n\n\"Fresh buying should only be considered if the index provides a strong closing above the 25,250 level, confirming a potential recovery.

Until then, a strategy of buying on dips and booking profits at higher levels remains prudent. Focus should also remain on stock-specific trades, as they offer better opportunities,\" said Rajesh Bhosale, technical analyst of equity at Angel One.\n\nAnalysts believe that 25,000 and 81,500 would be the immediate support zones for Nifty and Sensex, respectively, for day traders.\n\n\"Above the same, we could see one quick pullback rally till 25,200-25,250 and 82,300-82,500. On the flip side, below 25,000 and 81,500, the market (Nifty and Sensex) could retest the level of 24920-24900 and 81,000-80,700,\" said Shrikant Chouhan, head of equity research at Kotak Securities.",
