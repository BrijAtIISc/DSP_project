The month saw the index fall 6%, marking its worst monthly drop since March 2020. Relentless selling from foreign institutions, who sold in every single session during the month, coupled with earnings disappointments, added to the index's woes and eroded \u20b930 lakh crore worth of investor wealth.However, Samvat 2081 has begun on a positive note with the index ending higher during the token one-hour Mahurat Trading session on Friday. The start of November also is no-less packed with action as the Indian market participants will have eyes on all four corners of the world due to various cues emerging during the week.The all important US Presidential Election outcome will be known this week, as will be the US Fed interest rate decision. Consensus still remains that the FOMC will slash rates by 25 basis points after the non-farm payrolls howler on Friday due to Hurricanes and strikes. Manufacturing activity in the US also fell to the lowest level since July 2023.The four-day National People's Congress (NPC) also begins in China from Monday and will go on even after the Presidential election outcome in the US. The anticipation of another major stimulus announcement from the NPC has also begun doing the rounds and is adding to the uncertainty and volatility.Additionally, geopolitical tensions remain on the sidelines but continue to lurk around with reports suggesting that Iran me launch a retaliatory strike on Israel from Iraqi territory. The news led to a brief spike in oil prices as well.Back home, earnings season continues with multiple broader market companies, and big ones at that, reporting results in the upcoming week. Among the Nifty names, stocks like Dr. Reddy's, Titan, Tata Motors and India's largest lender State Bank of India , along with the newest index entrant, Trent, will be reporting results this week.For levels, even as the Nifty closed above the 24,300 mark, last week's low of 24,134 and the October 25 low of 24,073 continue to be the focal point for the Nifty. The continued rise in US treasury yields, coupled with a stronger US Dollar, may also act as deterrents to any potential recovery in sentiment.For the Nifty Bank , which turned out to be an outperformer in the week gone by, last week's high of 52,354 and lows of 51,012 and the October 25 low of 50,382 continue to remain the levels to monitor for the upcoming week.Samir Arora of Helios Capital during the Mahurat Trading session spoke about the fact that the next six to nine months, it will be good to look at growth companies but auto and consumer stocks may not do well.\"I feel that the longer term, medium term bullishness persists. I do see that we are going to, within 12 months from now challenge and break out to new highs,\" said Atul Suri of Marathon Trends. \"I still think that before next Diwali, well before next Diwali, we would hit a new high. We would push more towards the 29,000 to 30,000 level. Again, I am not giving any targets, but what I am trying to say is that as an investor, I do see the next 12 months to continue to be rewarding,\" he added.Market veteran Ramesh Damani also highlighted two themes that he would want to focus on for the next Samvat, which were Digital Public Infrastructure and Pharma.\"So, there are maybe half a dozen companies, and they are still trading at fairly modest market caps, not necessarily price to earnings ratio, but modest caps and compared to the opportunity that I see ahead for them, these companies are buy. So, whether it could be e-KYC (electronic know your customer), it could be PAN, it could be Aadhaar or Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), enormous opportunities in front of these companies and some of these companies will prove to be great winners over the next three to five years,\" Damani said.Nifty 50's November futures added 0.4% or 39,800 shares in Open Interest during the Mahurat Trading session. They are currently trading at a premium of 79.3 points from 182.95 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's November futures added 1.1% or 29,550 shares in Open Interest on Friday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.07 from 1.05 earlier.No stocks are in the F&O banOn the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,000 and 24,800 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 23,700 and 24,300 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.",

With the index underperforming on Wednesday, the Nifty found it hard to sustain by itself and having nearly recovered all the losses at one point during the day, ended with losses of over 120 points.With Wednesday's drop, the Nifty has closed exactly at the same level as Monday. The positive from this is the fact that the index has been making higher lows on the daily scale for the last three trading sessions.Despite a near-2,000-point correction from the record high levels last month, the Nifty is still on course to end Samvat 2080 with gains of over 25%, which will be one of the best Samvat's the index has had in the last few years.Both new entrants on the index, Trent and Bharat Electronics are the best performers on the index during the Samvat, although it has only been a month since they began trading on the Nifty. While Trent has nearly tripled in value during this period, BEL has also more than doubled.For now, the Nifty has managed to respect the immediate support of 24,300 on the downside and that becomes the first level to track ahead of the monthly expiry session on Thursday. The Nifty has declined over 1,800 points during this series, one in which it made a record high at the very onset.Earnings will also take a slight breather as the festivities pick up pace. Yet, L&T, Biocon, Tata Power, New India Assurance, TCI Express, Protean eGov Technologies, will react to their results that were reported after market hours on Wednesday.No major company will also be reporting results on the final day of Samvat 2080.Foreign institutions continued to remain net sellers in the cash market on Wednesday, while domestic institutions were net buyers yet again.Rupak De of LKP Securities said that the Nifty has seen resistance around the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average, leading to a move back to 24,300. He expects the Nifty to remain sideways within this range of 24,250 - 24,500 levels and a decisive breakout on either side will give direction to the index. 24,500 and 24,750 are resistances on the upside.The Nifty has formed a doji pattern on the daily chart, highlighting uncertainty among the market participants, said Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One. He sees 24,500 as a tough resistance for the Nifty on its monthly expiry, but a move above that can take the index to 24,600 and beyond. On the flip side, 24,200 and 24,100 are key support levels.The short-term charts of the Nifty remain in oversold zone and further short covering can be seen on the index from current levels, said Sanctum Wealth's Aditya Agarwal. However, he added that 24,480 - 24,520 will continue to be a stiff resistance and only a close above that can trigger an upmove towards 24,680 - 24,740 levels. On the downside, 24,280 - 24,240 levels are key support levels.Three straight days of gains for the Nifty Bank was not to be as it ended its October F&O series on a negative note, shedding 500 points, or half of what it had gained on Tuesday. For the series, the Nifty Bank shed nearly 2,500 points, despite the recovery seen on Monday and Tuesday. The index has managed a close above 51,800 and that will be the first level to track on Thursday, followed by Wednesday's high of 52,220.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty Bank has formed an inside bar candlestick pattern with support at 51,140 and resistance at the previous swing high of 52,580. He expects consolidation within this range for the time being with only a breakout on either side determining further direction.Nifty 50's futures across series added 10% in Open Interest on Wednesday with rollovers at 40% heading into expiry day. The October contracts, which expire today, are trading at a premium of 30.2 points from 10.85 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's futures across series added 21% in Open Interest on Wednesday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 0.91 from 1.02 earlier.L&T Finance and Manappuram Finance are out of the F&O ban today.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,400 and 24,600 have seen Open Interest addition for today's monthly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes of 24,100 and 24,300 saw Open Interest addition, while the 24,450 and 24,500 strikes saw shedding in Open Interest for today's monthly expiry.",

Nothing more, nothing less. The Nifty Bank staged a sharp recovery after respecting lower levels, taking it to the higher end of the range, and also taking the Nifty higher with it.ICICI Bank continued to lead the index higher for the second day in a row, while a few good results from PSU Banks like Canara Bank and Indian Bank boosted sentiments for shares of SBI, which also was among the leading contributors to the index upside.The other positive bit for Tuesday's trading session was that the Nifty respected Monday's low of 24,135 and rebounded from those levels courtesy of the rally seen in the Nifty Bank. Four out of the top five gainers on the Nifty were banking names, including HDFC Bank and Axis Bank, with L&T also stepping in with gains of its own ahead of its quarterly results on Wednesday.Wednesday will be the monthly expiry of the Nifty Bank and despite this 1,000-point upmove on Tuesday, the index is still down 2,000 points for the entire series.Despite the upmove seen on the Nifty Bank on Tuesday, there are some who continued to express skepticism on whether this is the start of a sustainable recovery on the index, that at one point, had shed 4,000 points from its record levels of 54,467.Jai Bala of cashthechaos.com said that the the Nifty Bank's recovery is most likely temporary and will possibly lead the next leg of declines. The index, according to Bala, will face resistance around levels of 52,475 - 52,950 and that SBI holding above levels of \u20b9735 - \u20b9765 levels will be important for the bulls.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty Bank has sustained above the high of an inside bar candle, triggering a bullish momentum and broke a short-term trend line. Immediate resistance is at 52,580 with support at 51,900. He advises using a \"buy-on-dips\" strategy on the Nifty Bank.The short-term outlook for the Nifty is turning positive but sustaining above 24,600 will be key for the index for this trend to continue, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. The daily RSI has also reversed from oversold zones and the support has shifted to 24,300, while resistance is at 24,600, followed by 24,660.Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities said that 24,400 and 24,300 will now act as a key support for the Nifty bulls and as long as the index sustains above the same, the bounce may continue till levels of 24,641 or even 24,700. On the downside, traders may exit longs on a slip below 24,300.LKP Securities' Rupak De said that the Nifty has risen after a bullish harami pattern with the RSI entering a bullish crossover, indicating positive near-term sentiment. He sees the Nifty rise towards levels of 24,750, with support at 24,250 on the downside.Marico, MTAR Tech, CONCOR, Prestige Estates, Voltas, Sheela Foam, HCC, Godrej Agrovet, are some of the stocks that reported results after market hours on Tuesday and will react to the same in Wednesday's trading session.L&T, Biocon, Tata Power, Dabur, IRB Infra, P&G Hygiene and Healthcare, New India Assurance, TTK Prestige are some of the stocks that will be reporting their quarterly results on Wednesday.Foreign institutions were net sellers in the cash market on Tuesday, but the net sell figure was below the \u20b91,000 crore mark. Domestic institutions too were net buyers but in smaller quantities.Nifty 50's futures across series have shed 5.1% in Open Interest on Tuesday with rollovers still at just 5.6%. The October futures are trading at a premium of 10.85 points from 9.3 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's futures across series added 5.2% in Open Interest on Tuesday with rollovers currently at 79%. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.02 from 0.96 earlier.Dixon Technologies and Escorts Kubota are out of the F&O ban today.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes of 24,650 and 24,700 have seen Open Interest addition, while the 24,500 and 24,400 strikes have seen shedding in Open Interest for this Thursday's monthly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,300 and 24,400 have seen Open Interest addition, along with the 23,700 strike for this Thursday's monthly expiry.",

The only question that will still continue to linger in the minds of the bulls is, will this be used as yet another exit opportunity or can this sustain, at least till the end of the ongoing Samvat?The Nifty traded in a very broad range of 360 points on Monday. At the start of the session, it did feel like a repeat of Friday as the index had slipped into the red, but it staged a sharp recovery soon after, testing the upper end of the broad range of 24,500. However, the Nifty ended nearly 160 points off the highs of the day, near the 24,350 mark.The midcap and smallcap indices, which have borne the brunt of this sell-off in the week gone by also did well, as most of the earnings surprises in Monday's session were skewed to the positive side. Barring Interglobe Aviation (down 8%), most of the other earnings reactions, particularly from PSU Banks like Bank of Baroda and Indian Bank, veered towards the positive side.Tuesday will be the monthly expiry for the Financial Services index, which will indirectly keep the Nifty Bank in focus as well. With the Nifty defending 24,000 for the time being, that has become the most important level on the downside to watch out for as a break below that can open up significant downside levels for the index. On the upside, 24,500 is the level the index has to sustain above for this bounce to continue.Tuesday's session will see stocks like Bharti Airtel, Bharti Hexacom, Tata Technologies, Suzlon Energy, Spandana Sphoorty, Federal Bank, Indian Oil Corporation, among others react to their quarterly earnings.Tuesday's session will also see the two Adani twins on the Nifty - Adani Enterprises and Adani Ports report results, along with other Nifty names like Cipla, Maruti Suzuki and broader market names like APL Apollo, Canara Bank, CONCOR, Deepak Fertilisers, Five-Star Business Finance, Genus Power, Godrej Agrovet, Marico, HUDCO, MTAR Technologies, V-Guard, Voltas among others.Foreign institutions continued to remain net sellers in the cash market on Monday, while the domestic institutions were net buyers but did not outbuy their foreign counterparts.Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One observed the formation of a spinning bottom pattern on the Nifty's daily chart, indicating indecision. However, oversold momentum indicators are pointing to a strong support at 24,100 and 24,000, while the immediate upside resistance is the 89-Day Exponential Moving Average at 24,600.The hourly momentum indicator has triggered a positive crossover and there is a high probability that the current pullback can continue till levels of 24,900 - 24,930 on the upside with support at 24,000 - 24,090 levels, said Jatin Gedia of Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.LKP Securities' Rupak De believes that the strength on the Nifty can persist as long as it remains above the 24,000 mark and only a sharp drop below that level can trigger panic in the market. On the upside, 24,500 is a resistance zone and a move above that can extend the current pullback.A majority of the Nifty's upmove on Monday was courtesy the Nifty Bank, which surged despite the underperformance of HDFC Bank and Axis Bank. The upmove was led by ICICI Bank, which reacted to a strong quarter, and was ably supported by other lenders like Bandhan Bank, Yes Bank and Bank of Baroda. However, just like the Nifty, the banking index could not sustain at higher levels as well and having nearly tested levels of 51,600 on the upside, it just managed to hold on to the 51,250 mark at the close of trade.The Nifty Bank has formed a bullish candle, signaling a potential short-term reversal, although the index remains below its 20 and 50-Day Moving Averages, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. A break above 51,600 can open up a move towards 52,000 levels for the index. But a drop below 50,900 can trigger a drop back to levels of 50,500 for the index.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty Bank has formed a bullish harami candle near its 150-Day Exponential Moving Average placed around levels of 50,390, which will now serve as an immediate support. If the index sustains 51,590 on the upside, it can move back to the 52,000 - 52,500 range.Nifty 50's futures across series added 12.1% in Open Interest on Monday, with current rollovers still at 5.3%. The October futures of the Nifty 50 are trading at a premium of 9.3 points from 11.95 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's futures across series added 8% in Open Interest on Tuesday with rollovers currently at 58%. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 0.96 from 0.87 earlier.PNB has entered the F&O ban.Aarti Industries, Bandhan Bank and NMDC are out of the F&O ban.Dixon Technologies, IDFC First Bank, L&T Finance Holdings, IndiaMART, Manappuram Finance, RBL Bank and Escorts Kubota continue to remain in the F&O ban.For the monthly expiry this Thursday, the Nifty 50 Call strikes of 24,500 and 24,800 have seen Open Interest addition, while the 24,300 and 24,200 strikes have seen Open Interest shedding.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,000 and 24,400 have seen Open Interest addition for the monthly expiry this Thursday.",

Since then, the index has not reported a weekly advance, nor has it seen any kind of move back to those levels. As of closing on Friday, the Nifty is down 2,000 points from those levels and on the verge of breaking 24,000 levels on the downside.The Nifty declined all five trading sessions last week, dampening some bit of festive sentiments heading into this truncated Diwali week. Laurence Balanco, the top CLSA chartist, at the start of last week called for further downside on the index, before it finds support near its 200-Day Moving Average (DMA) near levels of 23,300. That is still another 800 points away from Friday's close.For now, 24,000 is the all important level on the downside for the Nifty. The index broke below 24,100 during Friday's trading session, but recovered 100 points from the lows of the day. Despite this, there are enough concerns for the market to ponder over, particularly the extreme reaction to earnings that are currently being witnessed.Hindustan Unilever, Bajaj Auto, IndusInd Bank, Nifty constituents like these saw a fall between 7% to 18% post their respective quarterly results. With asset quality concerns rising among banks, and multiple consumption-oriented companies calling out weak demand, there are currently more headwinds than tailwinds that the market has to encounter.Friday was also the fourth straight week that the Nifty has declined. In a conversation with CNBC-TV18, Rohit Srivastava of Indiacharts said that the risk-reward ratio on the short side is more favourable towards the Nifty, in comparison to the Nifty Bank. He also mentioned that when the market is in a free fall, oversold levels do not necessarily work.The bigger worry though has come from the sell-off seen in the broader markets. Both Nifty Midcap and the Smallcap index had their worst weekly drop since December 2022. The Nifty Midcap index even slipped into \"correction\" territory, having declined 10% from the record high of 60,924 it had made on September 24.Friday's trading session will see stocks like Coal India, ICICI Bank, Yes Bank, IndiGo, Bank of Baroda, IDFC First Bank, Inox Wind, Balkrishna Industries, CMS Info Systems, among others react to their quarterly results, which were reported after market hours on Friday and over the weekend.Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, Adani Power, Ajanta Pharma, Sun Pharma, Ambuja Cements, Bharti Airtel, Bharti Hexacom, BHEL, CAMS, Federal Bank, Gillette India, IdeaForge, IGL, Indian Bank, IOC, Jain Irrigation, JSW Infra, Motilal Oswal, Paras Defence, RailTel, Sapphire Foods, Stove kraft, Sudarshan Chemicals, Tata Technologies among others will be reporting their respective quarterly results on Monday.Since the day the Nifty made a record high till closing on Friday, investor wealth of close to \u20b940 lakh crore has been eroded. Foreign institutions were net sellers in the cash market on Friday as well, taking their total selling in the month of October past \u20b91 lakh crore. Domestic institutions outbought their foreign counterparts for yet another session, taking their cumulative buying for the month of October to nearly \u20b996,000 crore.The weekly and monthly charts of the Nifty have shown significant distortion, suggesting further potential price correction, followed by a period of time-wise correction, said Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One, who added that the next key support is now at 23,900, which is the August lows, followed by 23,750 and 23,400. On the upside, 24,350 - 24,600 can now act as a near-term barrier.Vinay Rajani of HDFC Securities said that the immediate band of 23,900 - 24,000 will act as a support for the Nifty buit there can be some recovery from lower levels due to the oversold setups. The band of 24,600 - 24,650 should be utilised to exit longs and initiate fresh short positions. Any dip below 23,900 can drag the Nifty to its next positional target of 23,000.LKP Securities' Rupak De said that the sentiment appears extremely weak with any pullback getting sold into. He advises any pullback towards 23,300 - 24,000 be used to reduce long positions. The next key support is at 24,000, below which, declines are likely to extend.The Nifty Bank closed below the mark of 51,000 for the first time after October 7. The index declined in four out of the five trading sessions of the week, barring Thursday's rebound. The index was down 2.5% last week, marking its third weekly decline in four. Monday's reaction on the Nifty Bank will hinge on how its second-largest constituent, ICICI Bank, reacts to its quarterly results, along with some of its other components like Bank of Baroda and IDFC First Bank.For the Nifty Bank, 50,500 will be a key support zone, above which, the pullback formation may continue till levels of 51,200 - 51,500, said Amol Athawale of Kotak Securities, who added that a slip below 50,500 can take the index down to 50,250 - 50,000 levels.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates expects the Nifty Bank to bounce back to 51,000 levels till it manages to hold 50,380 levels on the downside. However, he advises using that bounce to book profits. A slip below 50,380 will take the index back down to 50,000 levels.Nifty 50's futures across series added 6.5% in Open Interest on Friday. Current rollovers, at the start of the expiry week, stand at 8.7%. The Nifty 50 October futures are currently trading at a premium of 11.95 points, compared to 52.6 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's futures across series added 3.7% in Open Interest on Friday. Current rollovers are at 0.1%. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 0.87 from 1 earlier.Dixon Technologies, IDFC First Bank and L&T Finance have entered the F&O ban.IEX and Piramal Enterprises are out of the ban.Aarti Industries, Bandhan Bank, IndiaMART, Manappuram, NMDC, RBL Bank, Escorts Kubota continue to remain in the ban list.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,200 and 24,400 have seen Open Interest addition, along with the 25,000 strike for this Thursday's monthly expiry.On the Put side, the 23,000 and 23,500 strikes have seen Open Interest addition, while the 24,400 and 24,500 strikes have seen Open Interest shedding for this Thursday's monthly expiry.ITC was the only stock on Friday that saw addition of fresh long positions. The stock ended 2.3% higher, with its open interest going up by 5.9%.",

        "text": "Trade Setup for October 25: Ten things you should know as Nifty wraps another painful week\nNSE\n\n\n\nThe Nifty has been making lower highs and lower lows for three straight sessions. It has declined on all four days of the week and on Thursday's session, it even struggled to cross 24,500 intraday, reversing from levels of 24,480.\n\n\n\nFor the week, the Nifty is down 1.8% so far. For an index, that did not decline for three straight weeks in 2024 until the last week, is now poised for its fourth straight weekly drop. The Nifty needs to close above 24,854 for a weekly gain, which is well over 400 points away from Thursday's close.\n\n\n\nThe broader markets do not inspire much confidence either. The Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices had given an inkling of the jitters on Wednesday itself when the sold off from the highs to end with modest gains. Both the indices ended in the red on Thursday after yet again opening and trading with gains during the session.\n\n\n\nThe underperformance of the Nifty on Thursday was led by the two FMCG heavyweights - Hindustan Unilever and ITC. While HUL could well go down as the Nifty earnings accident of the day, ending 6% lower after cautious management commentary and volumes missing expectations due to weak macros, ITC had a sentimental response to HUL's fall, ending nearly 2% lower ahead of its own results that were reported after market hours on Thursday.\n\n\n\nExtreme earnings reactions continued within the broader markets as well on Thursday. Here, KPIT Tech will go down as the earnings accident of the day, ending 13% lower after the management spoke of project delays, leading to a projection that the year will end at the lower end of the 18% to 22% growth guidance. However, there were positive reactions to earnings as well, with stocks like Piramal Pharma (up 18%), Aster DM Healthcare (up 10%) surging after reporting their financials for the quarter.\n\n\n\nAlong with ITC, Dixon Technologies, Godrej Consumer Products, IndusInd Bank, United Breweries, Petronet LNG, MGL, Castrol India, Radico Khaitan, JSW Energy, IEX, Oracle Financial, among a slew of other Nifty and broader market companies will be reacting to their results, which were reported after market hours on Thursday.\n\n\n\nJSW Steel, Shriram Finance, Interglobe Aviation, BEL, Bandhan Bank, Bank of Baroda, BPCL, DLF, GMR Power, Go Fashion, HPCL, IDBI Bank, Inox Wind, Inox Green Energy, JM Financial, Krsnaa Diagnostics, Phoenix Mills, Poonawalla Fincorp, Praj Industries, Mahindra Holidays, MOIL, Macrotech, UTI AMC among others will be reporting their results during Friday's trading session.\n\n\n\nAditya Agarwal of Sanctum Wealth wrote that all technical indicators of the Nifty are \"oversold\" from a short-term perspective and hence there are indications of a short-covering move. However, any pullback will be short-lived as the medium-term structure is weak. He advises using a move towards 24,620 - 24,740 levels as an exit opportunity from index positions and initiate fresh shorts. Downside support is between 24,320 - 24,240 levels.\n\n\n\nAngel One's Rajesh Bhosale also said that they remain cautious on the Nifty and only a decisive move above 25,000 will trigger a bullish reversal. Till then, he advises treating any move on the upside as a relief rally. Key downside support levels are seen at 24,350 and then at 24,200 levels, while 24,500 - 24,600 on the upside is a key hurdle.\n\n\n\nThe Nifty fall came despite the outperformance of the Nifty Bank, as HDFC Bank, SBI and Axis Bank could not offset the selling pressure seen in HUL, ITC and Hindalco. The index traded in a range of 600 points and yet again tested 51,800 on the upside, but could not sustain above those levels.\n\n\n\nForeign institutions continued to remain net sellers in the cash market on Thursday, continuing their selling spree, which has now crossed over $10 billion in October.

That fear did not disappoint during the final 90 minutes of the mid-week trading session.At one point, the Nifty had scaled levels of 24,600 intraday and was imperative to hold on to 24,500 on a closing basis to at least ensure the bulls sleep well for the night. That was not to be. The index fell 170 points from the highs of the day and ended in the red, its third straight day of declines. The 0.15% drop on the Nifty is not something that should bother anyone, but what definitely is bothersome, is the fact that there is absolutely no strength to defend any kind of bounce on the index.While Monday and Tuesday's fall came amidst multiple negative surprises, the fact that there were enough positive earnings surprises on Wednesday also could not improve sentiment in any form. IT was the only standout sector during the session, led by Persistent Systems and Coforge, shares of each ending 10% higher after a strong earnings performance and bullish Management commentary on the road ahead. The performance rubbed off on other Midcap IT names as well, with stocks like Firstsource (up 8%), Birlasoft (up 4%), Oracle Financial (up 4%) also showcasing a solid performance.In an interaction with CNBC-TV18, Laurence Balanco of CLSA projected the Nifty to fall another 1,000 points from current levels in the next 20 trading sessions, testing its 200-Day Moving Average, around the 23,300 mark for the third time this year. You can read more on that here.Wednesday's high of 24,604, becomes the first level for the Nifty to cross during Thursday's trading session, which will also be the weekly options expiry day. The day's low of 24,378, which also happens to be the opening level and from where the index bounced, will be key to watch on the downside.Thursday's session will see stocks like HUL AU Small Finance Bank, United Spirits, VIP Industries, Birla Corp, Pidilite, Piramal Pharma, Sona BLW among others react to their respective results, which were reported after market hours on Wednesday.ACC, Colgate-Palmolive, CSB Bank, Cyient, DCB Bank, Dixon Technologies, Godrej Consumer, IEX, IndusInd Bank, ITC, Laurus Labs, MGL, Nippon Life, Oracle Financial, Petronet LNG, PNB Housing, Westlife Foodworld among other names will be reporting their results on Thursday.Foreign institutions continued to remain net sellers in the cash market on Wednesday and there has not been a single session in October when they have been net buyers. However, they were outbought by domestic institutions for the third straight session.The previous Nifty support at levels of 24,600, which was also the 89-Day Exponential Moving Average has now turned into a strong resistance, said Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One. Until there is a clear sign of a bullish reversal, he advises avoiding complacent long positions. The bullish gap of 24,200 and 24,300 is a key downside support for the index.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said that the underlying trend of the Nifty is weak but there might be a bounce as per the weekly charts as the Nifty is now near key support levels. Only a sustainable close above 24,650 - 24,700 level could confirm an upside bounce. However, a slide below 24,350 can drag the index down to 24,000, he added.LKP Securities' Rupak De observed the formation of an inverted hammer pattern on the Nifty's daily chart, suggesting the possibility of a recovery in the near-term. 24,350 is an immediate support and holding those levels may see a recovery towards 24,750 levels. However, a fall below 24,350 might trigger a significant correction.The Nifty Bank too gave up gains during its weekly options expiry session, having tested levels of 51,550 on the upside but failing to sustain those as the day went by. The index closed exactly at the flat line but ended in the red. 51,200 remains the first line of defence for the Nifty Bank, followed by 51,000 further down.The Nifty Bank has formed a bearish candle after an evening star pattern, signaling potential weakness ahead. The index has fallen below its rising trendline, indicating downside momentum, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. In case 51,000 is breached on the downside, the index may decline further to 50,350, with the next downside support at 50,000. On the upside, 51,800 is a key level for any short-term reversal.Nifty 50's October futures shed 1.7% or 2.25 lakh shares in Open Interest on Wednesday. They are now trading at a premium of 47.15 points from 66.2 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's October futures shed 6.5% or 1.69 lakh shares in Open Interest. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 0.79 from 0.73 earlier.NMDC has entered the F&O ban today.Chambal Fertilisers and PNB are out of the F&O ban.Aarti Industries, Birlasoft, Bandhan Bank, GNFC, IEX, IndiaMART, Manappuram Finance, Piramal Enterprises, RBL Bank continue to remain in the ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,500 and 24,700 have seen Open Interest addition for today's weekly expiry.On the Put side, while the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,000 and 24,450 have seen Open Interest addition, the 24,500 strike for today's weekly expiry has seen Open Interest shedding.",

The answer? A loud NO. While Monday's session brought volatility along with it, Tuesday was a one-way drop for the Nifty and the market overall as every crucial level was violated and every small bounce intraday was sold into.Within a month of making a record high of 26,277, the Nifty 50 has already corrected nearly 7% from those levels, which is a fall of nearly 2,000 points in absolute terms. In fact, the Nifty made an intraday low of 24,445 and closed just 30 points above that. A close below another important level of 24,500 will also not please the bulls. ICICI Bank was the only index constituent that ended with some sort of gains.A sharper sell-off though, has been taking place in the broader markets. The Midcap index too is down 7% from its September 24 peak, but the ferocity of the fall has been a lot severe compared to the benchmark index. Out of the near-5,000-point drop that the Midcap index has seen, over 2,500 points or 50% has come in just the last two sessions. At least 35 stocks on the Midcap index are down 10% or more over the last one month. Shares like Vodafone Idea and Cochin Shipyard have even halved from their respective peaks.Earnings reactions were extreme on Monday, and they were extreme on Tuesday as well. Most of the earnings misses were punished anywhere between 8% to 10%. Supreme Industries (down 9%), Jana Small Finance Bank (down 9%) were some examples. Only City Union Bank stood out amidst this carnage, ending 12% higher on a day when most broader markets found themselves on the wrong side of the fence.The two-day fall has led to a cumulative erosion of \u20b913.7 lakh crore worth of investor wealth. The Smallcap index, which had been rather resilient amidst the Midcap fall, declined 4% in a single session on Tuesday. Barring Dr. Lal Pathlabs, every single stock on the Smallcap index ended lower.\"Every correction is unnerving. We have seen one after a long time, and that's why I think the reaction is what it is. I don't see any panic as such. I think the discussion is still on how much to put at what levels,\" Gurmeet Chadha of Complete Circle told CNBC-TV18 on Tuesday. \"I still think this is a buy on dip market. I think this is where you get more bargains. And a lot of these types - look at auto index had doubled. Recycling themes - those stocks had double. So some bit of a pullback is normal, and I think it will bring sanity to the market,\" he added.Wednesday, the day of the Nifty Bank weekly expiry, will see stocks like Bajaj Finance, Amber Enterprises, Can Fin Homes, ICICI Prudential, M&M Finance, Max Financial Services, Persistent Systems, Coforge, Zomato, among others react to their quarterly results.Wednesday's session will also see stocks like Hindustan Unilever, Bajaj Finserv, Birlasoft, Craftsman Automation, Godrej Properties, IIFL Finance, Karnataka Bank, Dr. Lal Pathlabs, MAS Financial, Metro Brands, Nuvoco Vistas, Sona BLW, TVS Motor, VIP Industries, Syngene, SBI Life Insurance, United Spirits, Piramal Pharma, Sagar Cements among others report results.Foreign institutions continued to remain net sellers in the cash market on Tuesday, extending their total selling spree in October past $10 billion. The domestic institutions outbought their foreign counterparts for the second day running.\"I had anticipated the short-term bounce to come through for the Nifty, but whereas for the Nifty, the bounce has been lacking, and in fact, it surprised me to the downside, whereas it came through for the banking index. That tells me the market is actually weaker. The nearest support for the Nifty is actually at 23,890 to 23,800. I'm still anticipating some bounce to come through, but the fact that the Nifty broke the October 7 low without giving a chance, that's a bit of a surprise and pointing to weakness,\" said Jai Bala of cashthechaos.com.Jatin Gedia of Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said that the Nifty has decisively slipped below its 20-Week Moving Average of 24,718, which indicates weakness and the daily and hourly momentum indicators are also in a negative crossover. He expects the Nifty to slip further down to levels of 24,000, where there is high Open Interest concentration on the put side. On the upside, 24,900 - 25,000 will act as a resistance.HDFC Securities' Nagaraj Shetti also said that the near-term Nifty trend is weak and a decisive move below 24,450 will open further downside towards levels of 24,000. Immediate resistance is at 24,700 and any pullback to those levels could be used as a selling opportunity.The Nifty Bank, which appeared to be the better placed among the two benchmark indices also fell prey to the selling pressure seen across the board on Tuesday. The Financial Services weekly expiry also added to the volatility on the index. 51,000 on the downside now becomes a very key level for the Nifty Bank to defend, failing which analysts expect further downside. The index will be in focus on Wednesday due to its weekly expiry.The Nifty Bank has formed a bearish candle on the daily chart, indicating weakness and the index is now very close to its 100-Day Exponential Moving Average support at 51,100, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. A sustained move below 51,000 could trigger further downside on the index, leading to a more pronounced decline, he added.Nifty 50's October futures added 1.7% or 2.16 lakh shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. They are now trading at a premium of 66.2 points from 7.7 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's October futures added 3.3% or 84,045 shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 0.73 from 0.93 earlier.Granules India, IDFC First Bank, SAIL and Hindustan Copper are out of the F&O ban today.Aarti Industries, Birlasoft, Bandhan Bank, Chambal Fertilisers, GNFC, IEX, IndiaMART, Manappuram Finance, Piramal Enterprises, PNB and RBL Bank continue to remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,500 and 24,700 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,200 and 24,400 have seen an addition in Open Interest for this Thursday's weekly expiry.",

But that is how Monday's trading session turned out to be on Dalal Street. Friday's rebound from the lows of 24,564 was short-lived as despite the best efforts from HDFC Bank and Reliance Industries, the index ended in the red, without any follow-up buying.For the 93 points contributed by the Nifty heavyweights to the upside, there was a team of Kotak Mahindra Bank, Infosys, IndusInd Bank, ICICI Bank and Tata Consumer Products to offset those gains.What would definitely alarm the bulls is the extreme earnings reaction seen in a many companies, mostly on the downside. Tata Consumer at one point fell 10% before ending 7% lower. Kotak Mahindra Bank too, at one point fell 6% before ending 4.5% lower after weak results.This proves the fact that we are currently in a market where there is \"zero\" margin for error and even the slightest earnings miss is being punished by the street. IndiaMART (down 17%), RBL Bank (down 13.5%), Mastek (down 6%), CG Power (down 6%), Gravita India (down 6%) are case in point. And these are just a few examples of multiple such earnings misses that were punished by the street.\"I think it is fair to say that,\" said Rakshit Ranjan of Marcellus, when asked about whether the margin for error for a lot of these companies is negligible. \"That is because of the kind of valuations they have traded at with earnings not being supported and I don't think this is a one-quarter blip. So a negative reaction should be expected because the earnings these companies (without naming any) reported over the last one to two years, were not sustainable,\" Ranjan told CNBC-TV18 on Monday.The extent of the sell-off in a lot of these broader market companies has also put the spotlight on the correction taking place there as the benchmark indices were grabbing the spotlight in recent times. The Midcap index is down over 5% in the last one month, not alarming by any means, especially considering the run-up the index has seen over the last 12-18 months, but 78 out of the 100 stocks on the Nifty Midcap index have delivered negative returns during the last one month, and that should concern the bulls, more so because the earnings season has only just begun.Shares of Bajaj Housing Finance, 360 One WAM, City Union Bank, HFCL, Jana Small Finance Bank, Mahindra Logistics, Union Bank of India are some of the broader market names that will be reacting to their results during Tuesday's trading session.Bajaj Finance is among the Nifty constituents reporting results on Tuesday, which will have a slew of broader market companies like Adani Energy Solutions, Adani Green, Amber Enterprises, Can Fin Homes, Chennai Petro, ICICI Prudential, Indus Towers, IIFL Securities, M&M financial, ICICI Securities, Persistent Systems, Coforge, Shoppers Stop, SRF, Varun Beverages, Zensar Technologies, Olectra Greentech and Zomato among others report results.Foreign institutions continued to remain net sellers in the cash market even on Monday but were outbought by the domestic institutions after a few sessions.Rupak De of LKP Securities believes that 25,000 is a key level for the Nifty and a failure to defend that led to the index falling to levels of 24,700. In case 24,700 breaks on the downside, the selling pressure may intensify but if it manages to hold, a recovery towards 25,050 could be seen.For Angel One's Rajesh Bhosale, the 24,600 level is key for the Nifty, which aligns with the 89-Day Exponential Moving Average, as a break below that could trigger a price correction and confirm a bearish breakdown of the head and shoulders pattern. On the flip side, 25,000 to 25,250 remains a key hurdle.The candle formed on the Nifty's daily chart on Monday shows the lack of strength in the market for a sustainable upside bounce, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. He said that the underlying Nifty trend is weak and he expects a revisit of the 24,600 - 24,500 lows in the near-term. Immediate resistance is at 25,000.All the gains made by HDFC Bank were offset by the losses seen in shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank, which resulted in the Nifty Bank ending with losses on Monday. The index did open higher, crossed the mark of 52,500 on an intraday basis but could not hold on to Friday's recovery, eventually ending 600 points off the highs of the session. Yet, the Nifty Bank appears to be in a better position compared to the Nifty when it comes to levels at closing on Monday.The Nifty Bank has formed a bearish candle but has closed above the 21-Day Exponential Moving Average near 51,915. On the downside, 51,100 - 51,000 zone offers good support for the banking index and Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates advises a buy-on-dips strategy on the Nifty Bank till it remains above the mark of 51,000.Nifty 50's October futures shed 2.7% or 3.51 lakh shares in Open Interest on Monday. They are now trading at a premium of 7.7 points from 95.1 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's October futures shed 2% or 51,975 shares in Open Interest on Monday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 0.81 from 0.93 earlier.Manappuram Finance, Piramal Enterprises, RBL Bank, IndiaMART, Hindustan Copper have entered the F&O ban.NALCO and Tata Chemicals are out of the F&O ban.Aarti Industries, Birlasoft, Bandhan Bank, Chambal Fertilisers, GNFC, Granules India, IDFC First Bank, IEX, L&T Finance, PNB and SAIL continue to remain in the F&O ban.For this Thursday's weekly options expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes between 24,800 and 25,000 have seen Open Interest addition.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,700 and 25,000 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's expiry.",

A recovery in banking majors during the final session helped pare some losses, with both the Nifty and Sensex closing at 24,863.40 and 81,224.7, respectively.Sector performance was mixed, with banking, financials, and realty posting decent gains, while auto, metals, and FMCG sectors were the top losers. The broader indices reflected a similar trend, as the midcap index lost nearly a percent while smallcap closed slightly positive.In the absence of any major triggers, market participants will focus on upcoming earnings for direction.Shares of HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Tech Mahindra, which reported earnings over the weekend, will be in focus on Monday.Additionally, Nifty 50 heavyweights such as UltraTech Cement, Hindustan Unilever, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, HUL, SBI Life, ITC, Bharat Electronics, BPCL, HPCL, Coal India, JSW Steel, Shriram Finance, and ICICI Bank are set to announce their earnings.On the economic front, key high-frequency data such as the HSBC Composite PMI, HSBC Manufacturing PMI, and HSBC Services PMI are expected.Foreign investors continued to offload shares, selling21,823 crore in the cash segment, while domestic investors maintained buying momentum, purchasing16,384 crore in equities.As per data from the stock exchange, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) offloaded shares worth over77,701 crore in the secondary market in October 2024, marking the highest monthly outflow ever recorded from the Indian stock market.\"This massive selling caused a correction of about 5% in Nifty, but didn\u2019t have a serious impact on the market since almost the entire FPI selling has been absorbed by DIIs, who are receiving sustained fund inflows. This trend of FII selling and DII buying is likely to sustain in the near-term,\" said VK Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services.\"The rationale behind FPI selling is the elevated valuations in India and the cheap valuations of Chinese stocks, which the FPIs have been buying aggressively since mid September. This \u201csell India, Buy China\u201d is most likely to be a short-term tactical trade; but it can run for some more time, given India\u2019s elevated valuations,\" he said.Despite the ongoing positivity in the US markets, the Indian markets have been largely unresponsive, a divergence likely to persist due to continued foreign fund outflows. Any change in the fund flow pattern would also be on the participants' radar, said Ajit Mishra of Religare Broking.Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services expects the investment strategies favouring China over India to tactically support for the short term. However, Nair said the long-term outlook for the domestic market remains robust with a stability in growth and a pickup in capex.\"We expect the market to be range-bound in the short term with mixed bias, while investors should turn more sector- and stock-specific in such a time. Focus will be on large caps and growth areas like staples, agriculture, FMCG, consumption, power, digital, and infra. Buy-on dips will be the strategy on a short- to medium-term basis,\" he added.The Nifty has moved up sharply after forming a panic bottom around 24,570, failing to sustain below 24,700, said Rupak De of LKP Securities. On the hourly chart, a positive divergence is visible on the RSI (14), indicating a shift toward positive price momentum. Immediate resistance is seen at 24,900, which previously acted as support.The analyst said that a decisive move above 24,900 could induce a short-term rally. The trend is likely to remain strong as long as the Nifty stays above 24,750.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said that Friday's sustainable upmove from the lows could be a cheering factor for the bulls to make a comeback. Followthrough upmove from here is expected to confirm crucial bottom reversal pattern. Immedaite support is at 24500 and the next overhead resistance is placed around 24950-25000 levels.Ajit Mishra expects Nifty to see some consolidation following three weeks of declines, but the outlook is likely to stay negative unless it decisively reclaims the 25,150 level.\"A sustained move above this could fuel a rebound, pushing the index towards the 25,500 zone. On the downside, the 10-day exponential moving average (DEMA), currently around 24,470, serves as key support, and a break below this level could lead to a drop toward the 24,000 zone,\" Mishra said.The Bank Nifty index opened on a weaker note but saw a robust recovery from its intraday lows, with the index maintaining a bullish grip throughout the session.Notably, no hourly candle closed below the previous lows, allowing the index to climb to the 52,199 level. It ended the day with a gain of 1.57% (+805 points) at 52,094, demonstrating a strong rebound by buyers from lower levels. On the daily chart, the index managed to engulf the previous day\u2019s selling pressure and closed above it, indicating renewed buying interest.Additionally, it closed above its previous week\u2019s high and crossed above the 20-day EMA after eleven sessions, highlighting a continued bullish structure, said Dhupesh Dhameja of Samco Securities.- Alembic Pharma has received the US FDA approval for Diltiazem Hydrochloride extended-release capsules used for the treatment of high blood pressure and prevents chest pain.- HDFC Bank: HDFC Bank has said it would sell equity shares worth \u20b910,000 crore through an offer for sale (OFS) in its subsidiary, HDB Financial Services Ltd, as part of the much-anticipated initial public offering (IPO) of the unit.On the earnings front, the bank reported a steady second quarter earnings, with a 5.3% growth in profit and a 15.1% deposit growth on a year-on-year basis.- MCX: The company has reported its second-quarter earnings.

As the week draws to a close on Friday, the Nifty bulls are now struggling to defend the lower end of this range, having closed at the lows it had made on September 9.The Nifty fell for the third day in a row during its weekly options expiry on Thursday and has now declined in four out of the last five trading sessions. With Thursday's drop, the October 7 low of 24,694 now comes into the picture again and defending that will be the first task for the bulls when the markets open on Friday.There were enough factors to spoil the mood of the street on Thursday. Bajaj Auto's results had no positive surprise and some cautious commentary from the management on festive season demand took the stock down by 12%, its biggest single-day fall since March 2020. Not only did Bajaj Auto tank, it took other auto stocks along with it, as fears of a broader industry slowdown resurfaced yet again.Real Estate continued to see selling pressure, as did Metals, barring NALCO, after another series of disappointing announcements from the Chinese housing minister. Barring IT, every other sectoral index ended in the red on Thursday.But the IT run-up will also be tested on Friday after Infosys' results, which did not have any positive surprise either. Despite raising guidance, it appears to be falling short of what the street had anticipated. At the time of writing this, the US-listed shares of Infosys (ADRs) were down 3.5%, while those of Wipro were down 4%.Besides Infosys, shares of Wipro, LTIMindtree, Polycab, Tata Chemicals and others will also be reacting to their quarterly results that were reported after market hours on Thursday.The three days of losses have ensured that the Nifty is now down 0.9% for the week, not an alarming number, but the index is down for the third straight week and in case it does not manage a close above 24,964 on Friday, it will be the first time in 2024 that the Nifty has declined for three straight weeks.Foreign institutions were heavy sellers in the cash market on Thursday and their selling intensity also picked up after tapering off for a few sessions. They have been net sellers in every single session during the month of October and have cumulatively sold more in the cash market than they did during the onset of Covid-19 in March 2020.The Nifty has broken down from a bearish flag pattern, suggesting a possibly downward move in the short-term, said Rupak De of LKP Securities. The RSI is also in a bearish crossover. However, he says this may not be the ideal level to initiate fresh shorts as the Nifty is nearing a double-bottom support which can trigger a recovery towards 25,000. But a break below 24,700 decisively could trigger further correction.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said that the recent highs around 25,200 can be considered a new lower top and a decisive move below 24,700 could form a new lower bottom in the near-term. He expects the Nifty to slide to 24,500 - 24,400 levels by next week on a slip below 24,700. Immediate resistance now is at 24,900.On the intraday charts, the Nifty has formed a bearish candle and the texture will remain weak till the index remains below 24,900 levels, according to Kotak Securities' Shrikant Chouhan. On the downside, he expects a fall towards levels of 24,550 - 24,500, while a pullback move to 24,900 could be seen in case the index moves above 24,825.The Nifty Bank has nearly reversed everything it gained over Monday and Tuesday. The index closing above 51,900 on Tuesday made it appear as an outperformer and one that could cushion the Nifty downside while moving higher post a breakout, but that hasn't turned out as planned.The index is back below both its 50 and 100-Day Moving Average and is now fighting to defend levels of 51,200 on the downside, which it slipped below intraday on Thursday. Despite this two-day fall, the Nifty Bank is still marginally positive for the week and needs to close above 51,172 to remain in the green on a weekly basis.Aditya Agarwal of Sanctum Wealth said that the Nifty Bank will continue to find support around the 51,000 - 50,800 zone and dips towards those levels should be used to initiate fresh longs for a short covering pullback. He expects 52,000 to be a resistance due to the aggressive call writing seen at that strike price.The Nifty Bank has formed a big bearish candle leading to profit booking and a negative close, indicating weakness, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. On the downside, the Nifty has a key support at 51,050 but a move below 51,000 could trigger further weakness.",

There was a day it struggled despite a strong global handover, but Wednesday, that strong handover was also missing. The weakness in the global markets, coupled with the index's own struggles at higher levels, took the Nifty back below key levels yet again.Yes, there was some recovery from the lows of the day, but more than the recovery, the fact that the index is just not able to sustain at higher will be the bigger takeaway for the bulls going into the weekly options expiry session on Thursday.The Nifty continues to be stuck in the range of 24,900 to 25,200. Even on Wednesday, it managed to defend 24,900 on the downside but could not sustain above 25,000. For the last three trading sessions, the Nifty is making lower lows on the charts, while the highs are oscillating between 25,000 and 25,200.We had also mentioned about the Nifty Bank on Tuesday evening that it could emerge as an outperformer in comparison to the Nifty but that too could not sustain above 51,900 on its weekly options expiry day, given the sour sentiment on the street. However, there is no significant movement there as the index has still closed above the mark of 51,800.What might just end up saving the day on Thursday would be a positive global handover and Reliance Industries, which announced the record date for its 1:1 bonus issue of shares after getting shareholder approval by a majority.Thursday's trading session will see stocks like Bajaj Auto, L&T Technology Services and Mphasis react to results.On Thursday, four Nifty companies - Infosys, Wipro, Axis Bank, Nestle India will be reporting their results, along with broader market names like LTIMindtree, Havells, CEAT, Polycab, Tata Chemicals will also be reporting results.Foreign institutions continued to remain net sellers in the cash market, selling more than what they did on Tuesday, while domestic investors remained net buyers but in a lower quantum.Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One said that the Nifty remains in consolidation mode but a break below 24,900 could open the doors for further weakness towards levels of 24,700. On the upside, there is a hurdle at 25,100, followed by 25,250 and only a move above that can trigger some bullish momentum. Until then, he advises traders to avoid aggressive bets.Kotak Securities' Shrikant Chouhan believes that the Nifty closing below its 50-Day Moving Average is largely negative but a fresh round of selling will only come about on a break below 24,900 on the downside. On the upside, 25,078 isa key level for the index for it to retest levels of 25,200 - 25,260.On the lower side, the Nifty will find support at 24,900 levels and a dip towards those levels can be used as a buying opportunity, said Aditya Agarwal of Sanctum Wealth. Some beaten down largecap stocks are showing first signs of reversal and that can help move the Nifty back to 25,140 - 25,260 levels.The Nifty Bank made an attempt to surpass 52,000 on the upside but failed to do so. However, the momentum if evenly balanced currently with the index looking for support from a rising trendline on the daily chart, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. He expects the uptrend to remain intact as long as 51,200 on the downside is held but a close above 52,050 is essential for further upside.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty Bank has formed a shooting star candle on the daily chart and is likely to face resistance at 52,030 in the near-term. If that happens, it could re-test levels of 52,500 - 52,800 on the upside. On the downside, 51,000 is a strong support and he advises a buy-on-dips approach as long as that level is protected.Nifty 50's October futures added 0.8% or 1.2 lakh shares in Open Interest on Wednesday. They are now trading at a premium of 77.5 points from 61 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's October futures shed 0.6% or 18,315 shares in Open Interest on Wednesday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 0.74 from 0.77 earlier.Bandhan Bank, Chambal Fertilisers, GNFC, Granules India, Hindustan Copper, IDFC First Bank, IEX, L&T Finance, Manappuram Finance, PNB, NALCO, RBL Bank, SAIL and Tata Chemicals remain in the F&O ban list.For Thursday's weekly options expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes between 25,000 and 25,200 have seen addition in Open Interest.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,800 and 24,950 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry, while the 25,100 strike has seen Open Interest shedding.",

The same transpired with the Nifty on Tuesday as the index gave up nearly half of what it gained on Monday. The struggle to cross highs of October 9 and 10 is turning out to be real for the Nifty as it yet again reversed from levels of 25,207 on Tuesday.The Nifty struggled for momentum despite enough positive cues from the global front, including a strong handover from Wall Street, a drop in geopolitical tensions, which led to crack in oil prices. While Reliance Industries dragged the Nifty lower on one side, ICICI Bank was the stock that lent it support, keeping the downsides in check.Auto stocks also witnessed some selling pressure as the Hyundai Motor India IPO opened for subscription. So far, India's largest IPO on record has received a tepid response with only 18% of the \u20b927,870 crore issue being subscribed at the end of the first day.With the Nifty continuing to consolidate, the levels for the index remains the same. It will first have to sustain above last Thursday's high of 25,134, before making attempts to sustain above 25,234, which is the high from last Wednesday. For now, all of Nifty's attempts are being met with selling pressure at those levels.Most of the major earnings on Tuesday were reported during market hours, such as HDFC Life, HDFC AMC, Newgen Software among others. Stocks like KEI Industries will react to its results on Wednesday, as they were reported after market closing.For Wednesday's session, Bajaj Auto, which was the top loser on the Nifty 50 index on Tuesday, will be reporting its results, while L&T Technology Services, Mphasis, Himadri Specialty Chemicals, South Indian Bank and Tips Industries from the broader markets will release their September quarter performance.Foreign institutions continued to remain net sellers but the pace of the selling slowed even further on Tuesday, in what was an relatively dull day in terms of institutional activity. Domestic institutions nearly matched the selling from foreign institutions.Jai Bala of cashthechaos.com expects the Nifty to move back to levels of 25,480 - 25,650 on the upside before reversing and breaking below the recent swing low of 24,694 on the downside. He said that the upside levels at 25,650 would be met with resistance. On the downside, support now lies at 23,890 - 23,800.On the daily chart, the Nifty remains trapped between its 20-Day Exponential Moving Average and its 50-Day Exponential Moving Average with 25,250 acting as a resistance and 25,000 - 24,900 zone acting as a support, said Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One. Till a suitable trigger for a breakout on either side, he advises buying on dips and booking profits at higher levels.HDFC Securities' Nagaraj Shetti said that the short-term Nifty trend is choppy and the market is now in a 25,200 - 24,900 range. Only a decisive move above 25,200 will trigger further upside on the Nifty towards 25,500 - 25,600 levels. Immediate support is at 24,900.While the Nifty remains stuck in a range, it is the Nifty Bank that is the index to watch out for as it gained for the second day in a row, not by much, but still ended in the green. ICICI Bank lent support to the index, even as other heavyweights like HDFC Bank and Axis Bank underperformed. The Nifty Bank also closed above the mark of 51,900 for the first time after October 3.\"If you look at the options data as well, the critical barrier at 52,000 needs to be evaluated and once we see a breakout about the same, we may see a very strong directional move towards 52,800 kind of a level. So, I think rather than Nifty I think which is consolidating right now, Nifty Bank is currently presenting a fresh opportunity to build some long positions here. The base is very well set at 51,700, so probably one can keep a stop loss at 51,660 on a closing basis and create some long positions with an intention that 52,000 would be breached during this particular week and we may see a rally towards 52,840,\" Sacchitanand Uttekar of Tradebulls Securities said.The Nifty Bank moved above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracemet level at 51,820, with strong resistance now at 52,350 levels, which is the 50% retracement. The hourly chart is also displaying a series of higher highs and higher lows, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. Support on the downside is at 51,500, which is the 50-Day Moving Average.Nifty 50's October futures added 0.8% or 1.1 lakh shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. They are now trading at a premium of 61 points compared to a premium of 93.55 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's October futures added only 0.2% or 4,980 shares in Open Interest on Wednesday.Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 0.77 from 0.99 earlier.Bandhan Bank and L&T Finance have entered the F&O ban today.Chambal Fertilisers, GNFC, Granules India, Hindustan Copper, IDFC First Bank, IEX, PNB, Manappuram Finance, NALCO, RL Bank, SAIL, and Tata Chemicals remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 25,050 and 25,200 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,850 and 25,050 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.",

The index closed above the 25,000 mark for starters, although it could not close above either last week's high of 25,234. However, it has closed nearly at the same level as Thursday's high of 25,134 and near the highest point of the day.A problem for such moves has been the lack of follow-up buying the next day. One good day results in profit booking at higher levels the next day and that has been a problem with both the Nifty and the Nifty Bank in recent times. Whether there will be follow-up buying on Tuesday, which will also be the day for the Financial Services expiry, remains to be seen.A key factor that will determine whether there will be follow-up buying that will take place on the Nifty on Tuesday will be the street's reaction to results from the index heavyweight Reliance Industries. While Jio reported strong results courtesy of the tariff hike, O2C remains under pressure due to lower petchem margins. You can catch all the key highlights of RIL's Q2 earnings coverage right here. Apart from Reliance Industries, HCLTech, Angel One, Sterling & Wilson, whose earnings internals were released after market hours on Monday, will also be reacting to their results.What can also possibly determine market moves is the opening of the Hyundai Motor IPO, which at over \u20b927,000 crore is the largest in Indian history till date. The company has fixed the price band between \u20b91,865 to \u20b91,960 per share. Click here to know whether you should subscribe to India's largest public issue. HDFC Life is the only Nifty constituent reporting results tomorrow, while from the broader markets, HDFC AMC, KEI Industries, Bank of Maharashtra, Newgen Software, PVRInox, Rallis India, and others will also be reporting their quarterly earnings.Foreign institutions continued to remain net sellers in the cash market on Monday although the quantum of their selling was lower, while domestic institutions were net buyers.Jatin Gedia of Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said that the Nifty appears to have resumed its upmove towards 25,500 levels after a three-day consolidation. Hourly momentum indicator has a positive crossover and hence the Nifty can head to levels of 25,234 - 25,360. Support has now moved higher to 24,920.The Nifty bulls are still facing challenges and hence traders should adopt a selective buying strategy, said Rajesh Bhosale of Angel one. The 25,000 level is a support, followed by 24,800 - 24,700 on the downside, while 25,300 on the upside is a key resistance. He advises a buy-on-dips strategy keeping these levels in mind.LKP Securities' Rupak De said that the sentiment remains strong on the Nifty as the index reclaimed the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average on the daily chart. This strength might take the Nifty to 25,350 - 25,400 levels. Support at the lower end is seen at 24,900.The Nifty Bank has ended at a very crucial level on Monday. The positive is that it closed above both its 50 and 100-Day Moving Average as well. The 51,800 level is one where it has faced resistance in the past as well. In case the index does manage to sustain above this level, further upside towards 52,000 and beyond could open up. The Financial Services expiry on Tuesday will keep the Nifty Bank in focus as well.The Nifty Bank has closed above its 50-Day Moving Average, signalling renewed strength, although it remains below the 20-DMA, indicating that it still has some ground to cover before confirming a sustained uptrend, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. The resistance on the upside remains at levels of 52,300, followed by 52,500, while the support zone has shifted higher from 50,800 to 51,200.Nifty 50's October futures shed 2.3% or 3.2 lakh shares in Open Interest on Monday. They are now trading at a premium of 93.55 points from 85.3 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's October futures shed 7.2% or 2.2 lakh shares in Open Interest on Monday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 0.99 from 0.84 earlier.IEX, NALCO and Tata Chemicals have entered the F&O Ban today.Chambal Fertilisers, GNFC, Granules India, Hindustan Copper, IDFC First Bank, PNB, Manappuram Finane, RBL Bank and SAIL continue to remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 25,150 and 25,600 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry, while the 25,000 strike has seen shedding in Open Interest.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,500 and 25,100 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.",

The bulls struggled for momentum at higher levels but ensured that the recent lows remain protected, at least on a closing basis.Domestically, all eyes are on the earnings season gathering pace with index heavyweight Reliance Industries reporting results on Monday, October 14. The stock has been a big underperformer in the one month leading to the results and has been a key contributor in the Nifty correcting from its record high levels of 25,467 to sub-25,000 levels. Reliance Industries shares have corrected 7% in the last one month. Besides the management commentary, focus will also be on whether the company announces the record date for its much awaited bonus issue.Globally though, the US markets had another good session with the Dow Jones emerging as the outperformer courtesy of JPMorgan's results surprise. The other two indices too ended higher. However, the much awaited Chinese stimulus announcements from the country's Finance Minister underwhelmed yet again.With the Nifty not having moved over the last three trading sessions, the key levels on the index have not seen a drastic change either. Last week's high of 25,234 is the first barrier that the index has to cross for further upside, while on the downside, the September 9 low of 24,750, followed by last week's low of 24,693 remain key.Foreign institutions continued to remain net sellers in the cash market on Friday as well, but domestic institutions could not out-buy them for the fourth session in a row, although they remained net buyers.Vaishali Parekh of Prabhudas Lilladher said that the Nifty is precariously placed near its important 50-Day Exponential Moving Average and near the mark of 25,000. She believes that the near-term support for the Nifty lies around 24,700, while on the upside, a decisive move is needed above 25,400 to improve the bias overall.Angel One's Osho Krishnan said that the Nifty faces an immediate hurdle between 25,250 - 25,300 levels and a strong break above that level will trigger the next phase of upside. On the downside, 24,800 - 24,700 zone is a key support and a move below that could trigger further correction. He added that he remains skeptical of the current dips being easily bought into.The Nifty needs to sustain above levels of 25,050 for a move towards 25,250 - 25,400 on the upside but the weak sentiment on the index may continue if it continues to sustain below that 25,050 level, said Amol Athawale of Kotak Securities. He expects the Nifty to test levels of 24,550 in case the index breaks 24,700 on the downside.After a good session on Thursday, the Nifty Bank failed to see follow up buying and the result was that the index reported a weekly loss, underperforming the Nifty yet again. Unlike the Nifty, the index is trading in a broader range of 51,780 on the upside and 50,000 on the downside, which needs to be protected to prevent further sell-off on the index.The Nifty Bank may have formed a red candle on the daily chart but a hammer candle has been formed on the monthly charts, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. In case the Nifty Bank sustains above the hammer candle high of 51,785, it could test levels of 52,500 or 52,800 on the upside. Till then, the sideways consolidation may continue, according to Yedve.Praveen Dwarkanath of Hedged.in believes the weakness in the Nifty Bank may continue as the ADX DI+ line has turned lower, indicating a possible fall. A key support further down lies at 50,200 levels and increased call writing at 51,500 levels in the monthly expiry also adds to the possibility of downside potential.Nifty 50's October futures shed 1.4% or 1.94 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday. They are now trading at a premium of 85.3 points from 119.45 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's October futures added 1.3% or 40,935 shares in Open Interest on Friday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 0.84 from 0.93 earlier.Bandhan Bank, Birlasoft and Tata Chemicals are out of the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 25,000 and 26,000 have seen Open Interest addition for this week's weekly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,700 and 24,950 have seen Open Interest addition. The 24,000 strike has also seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.",

It closed right at the mark of 25,000. It was courtesy Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC Bank, which posted a session of healthy gains after declining in seven out of the last eight trading sessions, that kept the Nifty downside in check.All eyes for Friday's trading session will be on the reaction that Wall Street has to the CPI data for September, which could potentially determine what will the Fed do in its November policy, after a very strong non-farm payrolls data has completely taken a 50 basis points rate cut off the table.On the domestic front, TCS will react to its quarterly results, which were a miss on the margin front. Revenues were in-line with expectations but most other parameters were also a marginal miss. Stocks like Anand Rathi Wealth, IREDA and Tata Elxsi will also be reacting to their quarterly results.With no significant movement on the index, levels remain the same. Wednesday's high of 25,234 will be the first level to watch out for on the index, while the 25,000 mark remains the immediate level to track. Levels on the downside too remain the same, 24,750, which is the low of September 9, followed by the recent low of 24,693.After its worst week of 2024, the Nifty is absolutely flat for the ongoing week and needs a closing above 25,014 to post a weekly gain.Another important announcement came in on Thursday evening from the NSE as to comply with the latest SEBI rules, it will stop the weekly expiry of the Financial Services index, Nifty Bank and the Nifty Midcap index. The weekly expiry will only exist for the Nifty 50 contracts starting November 20.Foreign institutions continued to remain net sellers in the cash market on Thursday, but domestic institutions could not outbuy them for the third consecutive session.Small-bodied candlestick formations signify tentativeness among the Nifty participants, said Osho Krishnan of Angel One. 24,800 is now a major support of the index and a decisive breakdown could further disrupt the trend on the index. On the upside, 25,250 - 25,300 remains a key resistance. He advises a stock-specific approach and avoid aggressive bets on the indices.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said that the double-bottom formation around levels of 24,700 is still not confirmed as the index is not sustaining with follow through upside bounces. In case the index sustains above 25,250 - 25,300 in the next one to two sessions, there could be a fresh round of upmove, that can pull the index towards 25,500 - 25,600 levels in the near-term.LKP Securities' Rupak De is of the view that the Nifty failing to conquer 50-EMA for the last two sessions indicates prevailing weakness. Downside support lies between 24,950 - 24,900 levels and a break below that could drag the index to 24,700 levels. 25,150 on the upside is a barrier and a move above that may open doors for 25,400 levels, he said.The surge in banking stocks on Thursday ensured that the Nifty Bank emerged as the outperformer and closing above one important level of 51,500. However it is yet to cross Wednesday's high of 51,700, from where it had reversed. That now become the key level to watch for the Nifty Bank during Friday's trading session. For the week, the Nifty Bank too is flat and needs a close above 51,462 to register a weekly gain.The Nifty Bank has formed a bullish daily candle as it moved above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of 51,220 and the next resistance now lies at the 38.2% retracement of 51,850, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. The daily RSI though, around levels of 45, is suggesting weaker momentum. Therefore, Mehra expects the Nifty Bank to consolidate between 51,000 on the downside and 52,100 on the upside.Nifty 50's October futures added 1.2% or 1.6 lakh shares in Open Interest on Thursday. They are now trading at a premium of 119.45 points from 101.95 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's October futures shed 3.4% or 1.1 lakh shares in Open Interest. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 0.93 from 0.72 earlier.Chambal Fertilisers has entered the F&O ban.Bandhan Bank, Birlasoft, GNFC, Granules, Hindustan Copper, IDFC First Bank, PNB, Manappuram Finance, SAIL and Tata Chemicals are already in the F&O ban.For next Thursday's weekly expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes between 25,000 and 26,000 have seen Open Interest addition.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,500 and 25,100 have seen Open Interest addition for next Thursday's weekly expiry.",

However, that was not to be. For a better part of Wednesday's trading session, the Nifty continued to move higher, carrying on from where it left off on Tuesday, but a swift reversal in the second half not only took the Nifty down from the day's high, but also end the session on a negative note.The key culprits for this? Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank, the ones that have led the recent sell-off on the index as well. Reliance Industries has now declined in six out of the last seven trading sessions and from levels of over \u20b93,000, the stock closed at \u20b92,749 on Wednesday, a drop of 10% in seven sessions and when your index heavyweight drops 10%, we don't need to explain what happens to the index. Reliance Industries is also set to report its September quarter results on Monday, October 14.HDFC Bank too is not far behind, having declined 8.5% with losses in seven out of the last eight trading sessions. Adding to Reliance and HDFC Bank's underperformance was a sell-off in index FMCG names as well. ITC, Nestle India, Britannia, most of these names saw selling pressure over worries of them reporting weak results.Thursday will be a very important trading session for the markets. Nifty will have its weekly options expiry, earnings season begins with TCS reporting results, the US will report its CPI figures for the month of September and other broader market names like Tata Elxsi and IREDA will also be reporting results.For now, 25,000 remains the key level on the upside for the Nifty, followed by Wednesday's high of 25,234, from where the index cooled off by nearly 250 points. In case of a downside open on Thursday, 24,750, which is the low of September 9 and the recent swing low of 24,693 become important levels for the Nifty to defend.Foreign institutions continued to remain net sellers in the cash market on Wednesday but unlike the last two trading sessions, domestic institutions could not outbuy them.Rupak De of LKP Securities believes that the very-short term trend on the Nifty is positive till it holds 24,940 on the downside, which is 50 points from Wednesday's close. A drop below 24,940 could trigger a correction down to 24,800 or 24,700, while 25,100 on the upside will act as a resistance, he said.Kotak Securities' Shrikant Chouhan is of the view that 25,050 is an important level for day traders, above which the index can move to 25,200 - 25,250 levels. However, a slip below 24,900 can accelerate the selling pressure back down to 24,780.The Nifty has not yet confirmed the significant bottom reversal pattern from the recent lows, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. At the lower levels, he expects the Nifty to find support between 24,700 - 24,600. Immediate upside resistance is at 24,250.The Nifty Bank too continues to remain in a range and the weekly options expiry came into the picture for the index on Wednesday. It found familiar resistance near levels of 51,800 and cooled off 700 points from the highs of the day, just about managing to hold on to the mark of 51,000 on the downside. Gains seen in SBI, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank could not offset the losses seen in HDFC Bank.On the lower side, the Nifty Bank will continue to find strong support between 50,640 and 50,460 levels, said Aditya Agarwal of Sanctum Wealth. He advises using those dips as buying opportunities, while on the upside, 51,740 and 52,080 will be strong barriers for the index.Nifty 50's October futures shed 1.3% or 1.9 lakh shares in Open Interest. They are now trading at a premium of 101.95 points from 118.5 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's October futures added 7.9% or 2.3 lakh shares in Open Interest. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 0.72 from 0.74 earlier.Tata Chemicals has entered the F&O ban today.For today's weekly options expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes between 25,100 and 25,500 have seen Open Interest addition.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,700 to 24,900 have seen Open Interest addition for today's weekly expiry.",

More importantly, green that sustained through the day. From writing about the Nifty being above 26,000 just two weeks prior, the bulls will see 25,000 on the Nifty as a sigh of relief post Tuesday's close. The benchmark index snapped a six-day losing streak on Tuesday, which led to a loss of nearly \u20b927 lakh crore in investor wealth.After the initial volatile phase on Tuesday, the Nifty settled into moving higher with minor dips getting bought into. The index yet again defended its September swing low of 24,750 and reversed from those levels. The fact that the Nifty closed one, above 25,000 and two, near the highest point of the day will give the bulls some confidence.But now comes the big question. Has the Nifty made its bottom for the time being? Will 24,694 now become the new swing low for the Nifty? Or will traders use this bounce to exit from existing longs and resume the downside on the index?Jai Bala of cashthechaos.com believes that the Nifty has a very high probability of testing its Lok Sabha election day low, which is still around 4,000 points from Tuesday's closing levels.\"I pointed out last week that Reliance Industries' underperformance is a case for the Nifty to drop and correct somewhere close to the June 4 low. And that is now the probability for the market. The market has a very good probability that it's heading towards the June 4 low of about 21,800 (21,281),\" he said.Wednesday will be another important session for the markets as the Reserve Bank of India will announce its Monetary Policy decision and the consensus going around is that while policy will be a \"status quo\" for the tenth time in a row, there might just be a change in policy stance to \"neutral\" from \"withdrawal of accommodation.\"Commentary from the RBI Governor on the road ahead may be a key factor in determining market sentiment in mid-week trading before TCS kickstarts the earnings season on Thursday.Foreign institutions continued to remain net sellers in the cash market on Tuesday, albeit the pace of selling was slower, while domestic institutions outbought their foreign counterparts for yet another session.Osho Krishnan of Angel One observed the formation of a bullish Harami formation on Nifty's daily charts and follow-up buying on Wednesday might confirm the same. 24,800 on the downside is a significant support and a break below that might drag the index down to 24,500 levels. On the flip side, a string of resistance zones lie between 25,100 - 25,300.The previous higher tops and higher bottom pattern on the Nifty was negated when it slipped below the September 9 low of 24,753 and hence the present upside bounce could be short-lived, fears Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. Only a decisive move above 25,000 can take the index to 25,400 - 25,500 in the near-term. Immediate support is at 24,700.Sanctum Wealth's Aditya Agarwal expects this short covering move on the Nifty to extend to levels of 25,200 - 25,350 levels with downside support at 24,850, followed by 24,750 levels.A 500-point upmove on the Nifty Bank also comforted the bulls on Tuesday, with the index closing above the mark of 51,000 as well. The Nifty Bank will be in focus on Wednesday not just because of the monetary policy decisions but also due to its weekly options expiry. HDFC Bank, the biggest laggard on the index in this sell-off, led the rebound as well on Tuesday.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty Bank has formed an insider bar candle near the previous demand zone, indicating strength. He advises a \"buy-on-dips\" strategy for the Nifty Bank as long as it manages to sustain above the 50,190 level. 51,800 on the upside will be a short-term hurdle.The Nifty Bank has formed a bullish Harami pattern, which signifies that the prevailing bullish trend may take a temporary pause, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. A complete reversal is yet to be confirmed and that will only happen on a decisive close above the mark of 52,000. He expects the Nifty Bank to move unevenly or remain indecisive with short-term resistance at 51,500 and 51,800, with support at 50,400.Nifty 50's October futures added 1.5% or 2.01 lakh shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. They are now trading at a premium of 118.5 points compared to a premium of 189.8 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's October futures shed 3.2% or 98,310 shares in Open Interest on Tuesday.

Open higher and the recovery gets sold into. The Nifty broke more key levels on the downside in Monday's session, carrying on from where it left off on Friday.The Nifty has now declined 1,500 points from its peak of 26,277 on September 27. Over \u20b925 lakh crore worth of investor wealth has been wiped out and 47 index constituents have reported losses between 1% and 10% during this period. You can read more about the three stocks that have still managed to hold on to gains during this period here. At one point, the Nifty had slipped below the 24,700 mark intraday, breaking below the September swing low of 24,750. However, there was some recovery from the lows of the day, leading to the index ending just a shade below 24,800.It is this 24,800 level, followed by 24,750 that stand as make or break levels for the Nifty. Gautam Shah of Goldilocks Premium Research told CNBC-TV18 on Monday that if the Nifty decisively breaks below the 24,800 level, then the bulls must prepare for levels of 24,000 on the Nifty in the near-term. You can read more on his Nifty and Nifty Bank outlook here. HDFC Bank continued to lead the losses in Monday's session as well. The stock is also down six days in a row and has lost over \u20b91 lakh crore in market capitalisation during this period. HDFC Bank shares had seen a brief recovery towards the close of trade but yet again that was swiftly sold into. What triggered that fall? Read more on that here. Foreign institutions' selling figure on Monday again bordered a billion dollars, with domestic institutions outbuying them with a heavy buy figure but could not stall the selling pressure on the index. FIIs have cumulatively sold nearly \u20b950,000 crore in the cash market in the last six trading sessions.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities believes that the underlying trend of the Nifty remains negative and the index can slide further to its next support leg of 24,500 - 24,400 in the near-term. Immediate resistance on the upside is at 25,000.LKP Securities' Rupak De said that the sentiment has worsened as the Nifty fell below its 55-Day Exponential Moving Average, indicating a bearish trend. He expects the trend to remain volatile in the short-term with a predominantly bearish outlook. The market is a sell-on-rise one as long as the Nifty remains below 25,000, De said.The Nifty is oversold for the short-term and a pullback can take the index back to 25,200 or 25,350 levels, said Aditya Agarwal of Sanctum Wealth. However, the undertone remains bearish as any upside will be used to initiate fresh shorts. A close below 24,700 could further deteriorate sentiment on the Nifty, which can drag the index down to 24,450 - 24,250 levels.The India VIX rose nearly 7% to cross the mark of 15 on Monday, and that showed on the Nifty Bank, which had a session that was volatility personified. It would not be wrong to call it a trader's graveyard considering the session it had. At one point, the index was down nearly 1,000 points, post which it recovered all of those losses to nearly turn positive in a span of 20 minutes, only to fall 1,000 points again from those levels. From its record highs, the Nifty Bank is now down 4,000 points, giving up all the gains it made starting September 11.Nifty Bank broke below its previous swing low of 50,370, highlighting the ongoing bearish trend, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. The index remains below its 50-DMA, while the 200-DMA of 49,200 will now be a key support. Resistance for the short-term is at 51,500, followed by 51,800.The Nifty Bank has seen a big red candle on the daily chart, indicating weakness, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. It has also seen a short-term trendline breakdown and closed below its 100-DMA support, indicating further weakness. On the upside, 51,000 - 51,100 becomes a resistance, while 50,000 and 49,650 will be support levels.Nifty 50's October futures added 0.3% and 39,325 shares in Open Interest. They are trading at a premium of 189.8 points from 159.25 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's October futures added 17.6% or 4.59 lakh shares in Open Interest.

However, that was not to be. The Nifty sold-off and swiftly at that from levels of 25,500 and at one point even slipped below that mark intraday.While the Nifty did huff and puff its way to somehow close above 25,000, it could not avoid registering its worst week of 2024, a week that saw \u20b917 lakh crore erosion in the overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies.Yet again, the trio of HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries contributed to over 40% of the sell-off seen on the Nifty during Friday's session, although FMCG stocks were the ones that triggered the move downwards during the final trading day of the week.Both Reliance Industries and ICICI Bank had their worst week of the year. While ICICI Bank fell 5%, Reliance Industries shed 9% in what was a week with only four trading sessions. HDFC Bank had its joint worst week since January this year, having shed 5.5%. Both Reliance and ICICI Bank have already given up all the gains they made starting September 11, while HDFC Bank is a few points away from doing so.From last Thursday's peak of 26,277, the Nifty is now down over 1,250 points. This brings two very important levels into focus. First of course, is 25,000, which the Nifty is hanging on to by a thread and the second being 24,750, which is the September series swing low and a move below that could trigger further fall on the index.The upcoming week promises no respite either. The tensions between Iran and Israel continue to remain an overhang as there has been no positive development on that front. This will also have an impact on the Reserve Bank of India's policy decision on Wednesday. While a majority of CNBC-TV18's Citizen's MPC believes that the RBI should not cut rates, they believe that there should be a chance in the central bank's stance to \"neutral.\"Earnings season begins in the second half of the upcoming week with TCS kickstarting proceedings on Thursday, October 10, along with other broader market names like Tata Elxsi, IREDA and others.The Nifty bulls may look for some respite on Monday considering the oversold setups and a positive handover from Wall Street post the non-farm payrolls data.Foreign investors sold yet another billion-dollars worth in the cash market on Friday, taking the overall selling in the last five trading sessions well past $5 billion. Domestic investors though, continued to remain net buyers.The sentiment on the Nifty has turned extremely weak with higher levels being used as selling zones, said Rupak De of LKP Securities. On the downside, the next support is at 24,750, while resistance on the upside is at 25,300.Aditya Agarwal of Sanctum Wealth also believes that the Nifty will see strong support between 24,800 - 24,750 levels and can see a pullback from that range, whereas 25,300 - 25,450 will be a strong supply zone and can be used to reduce long positions.Angel One's Rajesh Bhosale is of the view that a channel breakdown, strong bearish candle on the weekly charts indicates more downside potential for the Nifty. Levels of 24,750, followed by 24,500 will be the next key support, while Friday's high near 25,500 will be a key resistance. However, he advises traders to be cautious with short positions as well as some near-term bounces cannot be ruled out.The Nifty Bank also had its worst week of 2024 and is now just 450 points away from giving up all the gains it made starting September 11 till its record high of 54,467. HDFC Bank also saw no respite despite its quarterly business update and its shareholding pattern release, which made it clear that it is eligible for the second tranche of the MSCI adjustments as well.The Nifty Bank has formed an evening star pattern on the weekly charts, indicating a temporary shift in the primary trend towards bearishness, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. The index has slipped below the 40 and 50-Day Moving Averages and the key support now lies at 50,900. A break of that level can trigger further downside. In case of a short-term bounce, the Nifty Bank can move towards 50,900.Nifty 50's October futures added 3.4% or 4.51 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday. They are now trading at a premium of 159.25 points from 225.6 points earlier. On the other hand, the Nifty Bank's October futures added 6.5% or 1.58 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 0.68 from 0.88 earlier.GNFC has entered the F&O ban.Bandhan Bank, Birlasoft, Granules India, Hindustan Copper, Manappuram Finance, RBL Bank continue to remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 25,000 and 25,400 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,800 and 25,000 have seen Open Interest addition for this week's weekly expiry.",

While there can be many factors attributable to the steep sell-off, the lingering issue of the rising geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel acted as a key sentiment dampener.But there is no denying the fact that the Indian markets had issues of their own to grapple with. While the much awaited SEBI circular on F&O norms meant that a big overhang is out of the way, there will be some impact on trading volumes going forward. Add to that the FOMO rally in the Chinese markets, which is pulling money away from outperforming markets like India.Emerging Markets expert Adrian Mowat also admitted to tactical money moving out of India into China. You can read more on what he said here. The aggressive selling from foreign institutions continued on Thursday as well with a sell figure of nearly $2 billion. Domestic institutions though, continued to remain buyers at lower levels.The top 10 contributors to the Nifty downside contributed to nearly two-thirds of the biggest Nifty fall in two months. The index heavyweights Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank led the charge downwards. Read more on the top 10 contributors to the Nifty fall here. Friday's trading session will see business updates and the reaction to the same will continue as well. The handover from Wall Street will also be key as the markets will end the session ahead of the all important non-farm payrolls data, slated to be reported on Friday evening.Post Thursday's fall, the Nifty has already slipped below the closing levels of September 12, which was the first day of the index upmove towards newer highs towards the end of last month. The Nifty has already corrected 1,000 points from last Thursday's high of 26,277.Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One expects the sell-off in the Nifty to continue as the bearish momentum this time appears stronger. The next key support is seen at the 50-Day Exponential moving Average of 25,050 - 25,000 zone and in case that level is broken, the index could fall further to the September swing low of 24,750. He advises using any bounce to reduce long positions with immediate resistance seen at 25,500.Thursday's sharp weakness has changed the short-term Nifty sentiment to the downside, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities, who expects the Nifty to slide down to its cluster of supports between 25,100 - 25,000 zone, before showing any reasonable bounce. Immediate resistance is seen at 25,400.LKP Securities' Rupak De said that the Nifty has broken the support of a rising trendline on the daily chart, signaling a potential bearish trend reversal. The daily RSI has also broken below the rising trendline. Immediate support is at 25,070 and a break of that level can see a fall towards 24,800. On the upside, 25,000 - 25,500 will be a resistance zone.Between September 11 to the September 27 peak of 54,467, the Nifty Bank had rallied nearly 3,500 points. In the last four trading sessions, the index has given up 2,600 points of that rally. Most of the heavyweights, including HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank have given up most of their gains from September 11. In fact, Axis Bank has even slipped below the levels it closed on September 11. A fall below 51,010 in the coming sessions would mean the Nifty Bank having given up all the gains it had made during that eight-day rally.\"The Nifty Bank is at a very critical support, which is 51,500. If it closes below that level, it will again break the trendline from the June lows and that would not be a pretty thing to happen,\" said Rohit Srivastava of Indiacharts.com. If the upward trend towards 55,000 has to stay intact, the Nifty Bank should not break 51,500 on a closing basis.\"We need to watch the 61% retracement as well which means can the bounce really make a new high, can it get past that critical level and that level is going to be at around 53,370. So if we get past that then there are odds that we get to 55,000 if not any failure to get past that level would again open up another selling to the downside,\" he added.Sanctum Wealth's Aditya Agarwal said that the short-term outlook for the Nifty Bank remains negative and the index can test 51,500 - 51,200 levels on the downside. He advises using any pullback towards 52,460 - 52,740 levels as an opportunity to trim longs and initiate fresh shorts.Nifty 50's October futures shed 8% or 11.6 lakh shares in Open Interest on Thursday.

The preponed weekly expiry of the Nifty Bank and the regular financial services expiry played out on Tuesday, as the benchmark index had to endure a choppy session.In response to the rising geopolitical tensions, Jefferies' Chris Wood has reduced his weightage on India by a full percentage point and increased his weightage on China by two percentage points. He called geopolitical tensions the biggest risk to the equity markets in his latest \"Greed & FEAR\" note.With Tuesday's session though, the Nifty has tested a very critical level on the downside, which is 25,750. Many chartists have been calling for that to be a very key level for the Nifty and a break below that could intensify the correction. The Nifty reversed from levels of 25,739 on Tuesday and managed to close above that.Not only the rising geopolitical tensions and the cues from the US markets, which ended lower on Tuesday, the domestic participants will also have to contend with the new F&O rules released by market regulator SEBI on Tuesday evening, which includes an increase in the contract size to collection of upfront margins. Of course, all of that will happen in a phased manner but there will be ramifications of the same. You can read more on the new rules here. Thursday will also be the weekly options expiry of the Nifty contracts and business updates for companies will continue as usual. All eyes continue to remain on the banking sector updates and the performance on the deposit front. Kotak Mahindra Bank MD & CEO Ashok Vaswani told CNBC-TV18 that these deposit concerns are overblown.Foreign institutions continued to be net sellers in the cash market on Tuesday, while domestic institutions continued to be net buyers.Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One said that the outlook on the Nifty remains cautious with the next critical support emerging at levels of 25,600 - 25,500, which aligns with the 20-Day Exponential Moving Average. On the flipside, 26,000 - 26,150 remains a significant resistance zone and any bounce is likely to face selling pressure. He advises traders to reduce long positions on any rebound and avoid any aggressive longs.Heavy Call writing at 25,800 suggests that it may act as an immediate resistance for the Nifty if sustained, said Rupak De of LKP Securities. Immediate support is at 25,750 and a slip below that can take the Nifty to 25,600 - 25,500 levels. Only a move above 25,800 will take the Nifty back to 26,050, where sellers would become active again.HDFC Securities' Nagaraj Shetti said that the near-term uptrend of the index is intact and that the market has only shifted to a short-term downward correction. He expects the index to find support at 25,500 - 25,400 and bounce from those levels. Immediate resistance is at 26,000.The Nifty Bank remained exactly at the flat line for most parts of Tuesday's trading session, which also happened to be its weekly expiry and the index ended there as well, albeit below the line. It is now struggling to cross the levels of 53,200 on a sustained basis and that will be the first level to watch on the upside in case of a bounce. The index also closed below the 53,000 mark on Tuesday and is down over 1,500 points in the last three sessions.Nifty 50's October futures shed 2.7% or 3.98 lakh shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. They are now trading at a premium of 172.35 points from 179.3 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's October futures added 9.3% or 1.7 lakh shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. Nifty 50's Put-Call ratio is now at 0.83 from 0.84 earlier.Birlasoft has entered the F&O ban, while Balrampur Chini is out of the ban.Bandhan Bank, Hindustan Copper, RBL Bank continue to remain in the F&O ban.For today's weekly expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes between 25,800 to 26,000 have seen Open Interest addition.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 25,600 and 27,750 have seen Open Interest addition, while the 26,000 strike has seen shedding in Open Interest for today's weekly expiry.",

A 1,200-point drop on the Sensex, a 370-point drop on the Nifty would in general set of concerns, but this almost feels like a routine correction, and a much awaited one, simply because of the kind of run-up the benchmark indices have had in the last fortnight of September.Of course, all eyes were glued to the outcome of the SEBI board meeting and whether any measures will be announced in the F&O space. That was one of the trigger for the market sell-off on Monday. The other one, is the rally seen by the Chinese stock markets. The CSI 300 saw its best single-day rally since 2008 and the combined turnover on both the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses reached a record of about 2.6 trillion yuan ($371 billion) on Monday.That has sparked fears whether the smart money will start moving back to China simply because of the valuation comfort it offers in comparison to India, even as many experts believe that structural issues continue to linger in the world's second-largest economy.Veteran Emerging Markets investor Mark Mobius told CNBC-TV18 on Monday that the outperformance of China will be temporary and that if he had a $100 dollars to invest, he would put 50% of those to work in India. He also said that the Sensex should hit levels of 1,00,000 by the end of the year, provided no dampening measures within the F&O space are announced by the market regulator. Mobius also advised investors to be ready to buy in case of a correction.\"In general, we still feel confident that you could see around 14% earnings growth over the next sort of four to six years, which sort of should drive markets higher even with some multiple de-rating from current levels. So, you could still see decent sort of double-digit, early double-digit returns in the in the market on a sustained basis,\" Sunil Koul of Goldman Sachs told CNBC-TV18 on Monday.\"We still have a 27,500 target on Nifty and we are overweight the market in the context of the region. The markets have been stronger, so that's a 12-month target technically, but it's basically kind of 7-8% upside, which is 13-14% earnings and a bit of multiple compression is how we get to that number,\" he added.The Chinese markets go into a holiday week for the next few days which means no cues emerge from there. The US will also be reporting its all-important jobs data this Friday, which can determine which way the Fed heads in November's policy meet. Back home, domestic automakers will report their monthly sales figures for September on Tuesday and some negative brokerage commentary kept most of these stocks under pressure on Monday. Shares of Hero MotoCorp fell after UBS projected a 45% downside, while TVS Motor shares too declined 4%.The Nifty saw a long bear candle form on the daily chart which is also signalling a short-term top reversal action, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities, anticipating further weakness from current levels. However, bullish higher tops and higher bottoms remain intact and the recent drop could be in line with the new higher bottom. He expects support for the Nifty around 25,500 - 25,400 levels and expects a bounce from those lows. He sees an immediate hurdle now at 26,000.Rupak De of LKP Securities said that the Nifty fall on Monday was accompanied by a sharp negative divergence on the RSI, indicating potential further weakness. He expects sentiment to remain weak in the near-term with a key support at 25,750, below which, the correction may intensify. An immediate hurdle is at 26,000.The Nifty Bank, the key catalyst to the Nifty upside in the final two weeks of September has seen a very steep fall over last Friday and Monday. If Friday's 550-point drop was not enough, the index shed another 850 points on Monday. If we consider the fall from Thursday's high of 54,467, the Nifty Bank has already corrected 1,500 points in two trading sessions. Leading the way down have been the heavyweights, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank, that led the way up as well. Tuesday will also keep the Nifty Bank in focus ahead of the financial services expiry.The Nifty Bank has formed a big bearish candle on the daily chart, followed by the Marubozu candle, indicating further weakness, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. On the downside, he now sees immediate support near levels of 52,720, where the 21-Day Exponential Moving Average is placed, followed by the 50-DEMA at 51,890 levels. He advises booking profits at any bounce towards levels of 53,000 - 53,350.",

The index ended in the red, correcting 100 points off the highs, not before registering another record high though and nearly testing levels of 26,300 on the upside.However, Friday's sluggish session did not stop the Nifty from posting its third consecutive weekly advance and the index is also poised to end the month of September on a high as well. That six-day rally saw the Nifty gain nearly 900 points marking its fourth straight positive F&O series as well.Monday will be the final trading day of the quarter, post which companies will begin to report their business updates for the period gone by. That will be one of the key triggers to determine whether the Nifty is able to sustain its record high levels. A major part of the recent Nifty rally has been the Nifty Bank and the banking sector updates may determine which way the index moves.There have been concerns over rising credit card defaults and that may act as an overhang for a lot of these major banks. The other concern emerges from the Middle East, where tensions between Iran, Israel and the Hezbollah continue to escalate with continued attacks on Lebanon. That will also keep oil prices and the subsequent reaction in the country's oil sensitives in focus.Another factor to watch out for next week will be the all important jobs data from the US on October 4. US markets have continued to rally post the Fed rate cut with Wall Street indices also posting a third straight weekly gain. But the pace of the rally appears to have been slowing down courtesy the underperformance of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Friday.Domestic investors were heavy buyers in the cash market on Friday but foreign investors were net sellers. The numbers will also be skewed due to the Nifty indices and CPSE rebalancing on Friday, which impacted flows in stocks. The Nifty will see two new entrants - Trent and BEL start to trade from Friday, while LTIMindtree and Divis Laboratories will be excluded.The Nifty has formed a long bull candle on the weekly charts which is the third consecutive candle, which indicates thae uptrend may continue, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. He expects some consolidation for the Nifty in the next few sessions before the uptrend resumes with downside support now at 25,900.Kotak Securities' Amol Athawale said that buying on dips and selling on rallies will be the ideal strategy for short-term traders. For them, 26,100 and 26,000 is an important level for the Nifty, while 26,400 - 26,500 will be a key hurdle. He expects traders to exit their longs on a move below 26,000 on the index.Praveen Dwarakanath of Hedged.in said that the market view is still on the upside with an upcoming target of 26,500 on the Nifty. Options data for the October expiry shows increased put writing and short covering in the In-The-Money and Out-of-the-Month calls, showing signs of continuation of the present rally.The Nifty Bank facing selling pressure on Friday was one of the key reasons behind the Nifty taking a breather on Friday and ending in the red. The Nifty Bank shaved off nearly 550 points from its recent rally of over 3,000 points, closing below the mark of 54,000. However, the index did manage to post gains for the week. The Nifty Bank will be one of the key factors that will determine the Nifty trajectory for the October series.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates believes that the Nifty Bank has formed a bearish Marubozo candle on the daily charts, indicating weakness but is still holding above the breakout point of the rounding bottom pattern. He expects an immediate hurde for the Nifty Bank at levels of 54,000 and 54,500 and a dip towards levels of 53,350 - 53,400 levels. If that does happen, he advises considering that as a buying opportunity.Nifty 50's October futures added 1.5% or 2.4 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday. They are currently trading at a premium of 166.2 points. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's October futures fell 3% or 56,685 shares in Open Interest on Friday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 1.2 from 1.36 earlier.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 26,250 to 27,000 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry, the first of the October series.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 25,800 to 26,300 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.",

The first half of 9 sessions where the index did precious little, and by the close of September 11, the Nifty was down over 250 points for the series. However, the next 11 sessions till expiry on Thursday, have seen a one-way move for the index.The Nifty has gained 1,300 points in the 11 trading sessions since September 11, rounding off the September series with a bang. For the series as a whole, the Nifty gained over 1,000 points and registered its fourth straight positive F&O series.Thursday resulted in a sixth straight day of gains for the Nifty and this six-day winning streak itself has resulted in gains of over 800 points for the index, powered by the index heavyweights HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank. The Nifty Bank has been a key catalyst in this surge that the Nifty has seen going into a fresh series.Auto stocks led by Maruti powered the Nifty ahead during Thursday's trading session. India's largest passenger car manufacturer now has a market capitalisation of well over \u20b94 lakh crore. The other bits of gains came from Metal stocks, which continued to rally on hopes of further stimulus being injected in China.Friday's trading session will see the Nifty index rejig taking place post closing and Trent and Bharat Electronics (BEL) will become part of the Nifty 50, replacing LTIMindtree and Divis Laboratories. There will also be rejig in the Nifty Bank and the Nifty 500, and an increase and decline in weightage in a lot of stocks.For the week so far, the Nifty is now up 1.6% and is set for its third straight weekly gain. The index has now gained in six out of the last seven weeks.Both foreign and domestic institutions were net buyers in the cash market on Thursday.Given the current overbought market conditions, it will be wise for traders to book profits at higher levels and look for re-entry opportunities during corrective phases, said Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One. The 200% retracement of the August fall at 26,300 - 26,400 will be a key resistance for the Nifty, while a strong support is seen at 25,850 levels.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities believes that the Nifty can now move higher to levels of 26,900, which is the 1.786% Fibonacci extension in the next couple of weeks. The underlying Nifty trend remains positive with support at 26,000.LKP Securities' Rupak De is of the view that the Nifty has broken out of the consolidation pattern on the daily time frame and that the positive momentum will continue till the Nifty remains above the 26,000 level.The Nifty Bank registered yet another day of gains, continuing to post record highs, on similar lines to the Nifty. The index did face some resistance at the 54,500 mark, but 54,467 is now the latest record high for the banking index. The Nifty Bank still ended the gains with over 270 points and has now gained in 10 out of the last 11 trading sessions. For the week, the Nifty Bank is up over a percent and is set to gain for the third straight week.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates continues to maintain that the Nifty Bank will face resistance at 54,500, which it did on Thursday and only sustaining above that will take the index to 55,000 - 55,500 levels. He recommends a buy-on-dips strategy for the index.",

The most minor dip gets bought into swiftly and the index continues to scale new peaks. Wednesday's session was no different and 26,032 is now the new record high for the Nifty and it remains to be seen for how long will that stay.It was a surge in the index heavyweights in the final few minutes of the trading session that took the Nifty to a new peak. HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, all of them saw a spurt during the final half hour, propelling the index higher. The monthly expiry of the Nifty Bank also had a role to play.Otherwise, it was a rather sluggish session for the Nifty as at one point, it even slipped below the 25,900 mark but that dip was quickly bought and the index recovered over 130 points from the lows to end above the mark of 26,000 for the first time.But even as the Nifty, Sensex and the Nifty Bank continue to scale new peaks, it may not necessarily imply that everything is hunky dory with the markets and that has got to do with the underperformance of the midcap and the smallcap indices. The midcap index snapped a three-day winning streak but the smallcap index fell for the second day running and has now declined in five out of the last seven trading sessions.Thursday is the monthly expiry of the Nifty and the index has gained over 850 points so far this series. This will be the fourth consecutive F&O Series that the Nifty ends with gains, having gained over 300 points in August as well.Foreign institutions were net sellers in the cash market on Wednesday, while domestic institutions were net buyers. The numbers could also be skewed due to block deals seen in stocks like Easy Trip Planners and KPR Mill.Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities believes that the charts indicates further upside from current levels. For the trend following traders, 25,875 will be a key support level, above which, the Nifty could move to 26,100 - 26,150 levels. On the downside, a slip below 25,875 can take the Nifty down to 25,800 - 25,775 levels.The next level to watch on the Nifty is the 1.618% Fibonacci extension level between 26,200 - 26,300 with immediate support on the downside at 25,800, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities.LKP Securities' Rupak De said that the positive sentiment on the Nifty will persist as long as it remains above the mark of 25,900, where aggressive put writing has been seen. He also sees no reversal in the momentum indicators. Therefore, he expects rangebound to positive moves on the Nifty in the near-term towards levels of 26,200 - 26,250.The Nifty Bank, which took a breather on Tuesday after an eight-day rally was back to winning ways, not before starting off on a negative note and recovered over 350 points from the lows of the day to close above the mark of 54,000 again. The Nifty Bank has now gained in nine out of the last 10 trading sessions and gained close to 3,000 points in the September series.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates continues to maintains that the Nifty Bank will continue to face resistance at the 54,500 mark, above which the index can test levels of 55,000 - 55,500 levels. He recommends a buy-on-dips strategy with key support levels at 53,350 and 53,000 levels on the downside.Nifty 50 futures across series added 2.4% in Open Interest on Wednesday.

However, technical factors, along with the Nifty Financial Services expiry took the index back to levels at which it closed on Monday.Nonetheless, 26,011 becomes the new record high for the Nifty, which has now gained over 1,000 points in the last nine trading sessions, starting September 11.While the focus remained on the Nifty, there was plenty of stock-specific activity within the broader markets with the Midcap index clinging on to some gains but the smallcap index, ended with losses of over 0.5%. Stocks like AstraZeneca and IEX moved on their respective newsflow, while names like SH Kelkar and Arvind Smartspaces surged on positive brokerage commentary.With the Nifty having moved the way it has, with domestic triggers still a week away from emerging and a landmark and a major event out of the way, the question now emerges whether it will be prudent to book profits at current levels and then wait for earnings to shape up starting the second week of October. By next week, companies will already begin sharing their quarterly business updates and that becomes the next major trigger for the markets.Selling pressure did emerge in the final few minutes of trade as the Nifty, after scaling 26,000, fell almost 70 points from the highs. Wednesday will also be the monthly expiry of the Nifty Bank index and that has been the index to watch out for over the last few trading sessions.Foreign institutions were net sellers in the cash market on Tuesday, while domestic institutions were net buyers.Osho Krishnan of Angel One said that with the current overbought conditions on the Nifty, it will be prudent to refrain from any aggressive bets and keep booking profits at higher levels. 26,000 continues to remain a resistance on the index and a break above that can take the Nifty to 26,200, while on the downside, support is seen in the 25,750 - 25,700 zone.LKP Securities' Rupak De believes that for the Nifty to continue moving higher, it needs a decisive break above levels of 26,000 until which, the index can continue to trade in this 200-point band between 25,800 - 26,000.Although the Nifty's near-term uptrend is intact, Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities expects some short-term consolidation or a minor dip on the index. Immediate resistance on the upside is between 26,250, while downside support is at 25,800.The Nifty Bank has been the key catalyst for the Nifty's journey between 25,000 and 26,000. The eight-day winning streak of the banking index finally came to an end on Tuesday, when it ended with losses of just over 100 points. During this eight-day rally, the Nifty Bank surged over 3,000 points, led by the index heavyweights HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, along with underperforming names like Bandhan Bank and Kotak Bank.Wednesday will be the monthly expiry of the Nifty Bank and the index has gained nearly 3,000 points during this series, most of which has come during this eight-day rally.The Nifty Bank is currently oscillating in a rising channel and may face some resistance at the 54,500 mark on the upside, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. A break above that level can take the Nifty Bank to levels of 55,000 - 55,500 on the upside. Supports lower down are seen between 53,350 and 53,000.Nifty 50's futures across series added 10.6% in Open Interest on Tuesday with current rollovers being at 89%. The September futures are currently trading at a premium of 4.3 points compared to a discount of 21.2 points. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's futures across series added 17.8% in Open Interest on Tuesday with rollovers being at 56.58%. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.31 from 1.42 earlier.Hindustan Copper and IEX have entered the F&O ban.Aarti Industries, Biocon, Chambal Fertilisers, GNFC, LIC Housing Finance, NALCO, Oracle Financial, PNB and SAIL are out of the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 25,900 and 26,100 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's monthly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 25,900 and 26,000 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's monthly expiry.",

In case that does happen on Tuesday, it would have taken the Nifty 38 trading sessions to get to 26,000 from the day it first scaled 25,000 on August 1.However, if recent moves are taken into consideration, the Nifty has already risen 1,000 points in the last eight trading sessions, which is from the September 11, close of 24,918. The fact that the Nifty has closed near the highest point of the day will also please the bulls.Beaten down sectors in recent times like the PSU Bank index turned out to be the top performer during Monday's trading session. The index saw its biggest single-day gain since June 3, which also saw the index make a near-term top. Since then, most PSU Banks are down between 20% to 30%. How do they stack up on the valuation front? You can read more here. Barring IT, most of the other sectoral indices had a field day on Monday, including real estate and auto stocks. Some PSU names also saw a rebound, except for defence PSUs, which saw continued selling pressure.Tuesday will also be the weekly expiry for the Nifty Financial Services index, which will keep the banking stocks in focus.Both foreign and domestic investors were net buyers in the cash market on Monday.Osho Krishnan of Angel One believes that the 26,000 mark will be a formidable barrier for the Nifty in its ongoing momentum. The lower end support has now shifted higher towards 25,800 - 25,750 mark, followed by 25,650 - 25,600 levels. He advises securing profits at regular intervals instead of being complacent.A reasonable bull candle was formed on Nifty's daily chart with a gap-up opening and this pattern indicates a follow-through upmove post a sharp upside breakout, observed Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. He expects the Nifty to now head to its 1.617% Fibonacci extension target of 26,250 in the near-term, with downside support at 25,750.LKP Securities' Rupak De said that the Nifty on the downside may find support at levels of 25,700 but the current momentum may take the index to 26,200 levels in the near-term. He expects the positive sentiment to persist as long as the Nifty remains above the 25,700 mark.The Nifty Bank has been leading the charge on the Nifty in this recent upmove. The index has now gained for eight days in a row and from the closing levels of September 11, the banking index has already gained 3,000 points. While it was largecap private banks that were leading for a better part of this upmove, the PSU Banks also stepped up on Monday and have been doing so over the last couple of trading sessions. The Nifty Bank tested record levels of 54,200 on the upside on Monday. The Financial Services expiry on Tuesday will continue to keep the index in focus.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities believes that the Nifty Bank now faces a key hurdle at the 127.2% Fibonacci extension of 54,400 levels and a break above this point could take the index higher to 54,800. Immediate support on the downside is seen at 53,750, which can act as a buffer for any potential retracement.The Nifty Bank is currently trading in a channel and may face resistance at 54,500, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. He further added that a break above these levels can lead to testing of levels of 55,000 - 55,500 on the upside for the banking index. On the downside, 53,350 - 53,000 will be a strong support.Nifty 50's futures across series added 23.8% in Open Interest on Monday. Rollovers currently stand at 29.9% for the Nifty futures. The September futures of the Nifty are currently trading at a premium of 21.2 points coimpared to a discount of 23.2 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's futures across series added 12.6% in Open Interest on Monday with rollovers currently at 11.9%. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is currently at 1.42 from 1.5 earlier.Aditya Birla Fashion and Vodafone Idea have entered the F&O ban.RBL Bank has exited the F&O ban.Aarti Industries, Biocon, Chambal Fertilisers, GNFC, Granules India, LIC Housing, NALCO, Oracle Financial, PNB and SAIL continue to remain in the F&O ban.For this Thursday's monthly expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes between 25,900 and 26,000 have seen Open Interest addition, while the 25,700 strike has seen Open Interest shedding.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 25,800 and 26,000 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's monthly expiry.",

By Friday, the index has already rallied nearly 1,000 points from those levels and is on the cusp of 26,000, just four days before the September F&O series comes to an end.Friday was yet another session that kept both the bulls and the bears in play. The final closing is no proof of how choppy the session actually was. At one point, the Nifty tested levels of 25,850 on the upside but within a few minutes, it fell to levels below 25,450, only to recovery and end close to the 25,800 mark again.After the choppy Friday session, the Nifty ended 1.8% higher for the week and has now gained in five out of the last six weeks. From the budget day low, exactly two months earlier at 21,281, the Nifty has now gained over 4,500 points.This will also be the September series expiry week and the focus will now shift back to domestic factors as the major global event is out of the way. After a week of lull, the first week of October will start with companies reporting their quarterly business updates before IT companies kickstart the September quarter earnings season.The handover from Wall Street is a subdued one as the benchmark indices had a quiet session on Friday but not before they notched up yet another week of gains and the Dow Jones ended at a record high.For Friday's trading session, foreign institutions were net buyers in the cash market, while domestic institutions were net sellers. The FII buy number is a heavy one due to the FTSE All World Rebalancing, which resulted in net inflows worth $1 billion towards the final minutes of the trading session on Friday, which is another factor behind the recovery in the markets.Amol Athawale of Kotak Securities believes that a bullish candle on the weekly chart and a higher bottom formation on the daily charts suggests further upside on the Nifty from current levels. He expects the index to rally to levels of 26,000 - 26,200 on the upside, till it holds levels of 25,500.The market structure remains bullish overall and the Nifty is now moving to its next resistance zone of 25,920 - 26,000, said Aditya Agarwal of Sanctum Wealth. He advises using dips towards 25,660 - 25,520 levels as buying opportunities for the short-term.The most important factor behind the surge in the Nifty through the last two weeks has been the outperformance in the Nifty Bank index, which has definitely looked the stronger benchmark in comparison to the Nifty. The banking index has surged nearly 2,800 points in the last seven trading sessions, ending close to the mark of 54,000 on Friday. The move has been led by the two heavyweights - HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, the latter having hit a record high last week.In an interaction with CNBC-TV18 on Friday, technical analyst Manas Jaiswal said that a positional target on the Nifty Bank could be 55,000 on the upside.The Nifty Bank has formed a strong bullish candle on the daily chart and is now above the short-term moving averages, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. He said that the Nifty Bank can extend its upmove towards levels of 54,100 till it holds its downside support of 53,200. It can also test the 127.2% Fibonacci extension targets of 54,380.Nifty 50's September futures added 5.6% and 7.35 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday. They are now trading at a discount of 23.2 points from a premium of 73.3 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's September futures shed 8% or 1.75 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.5 from 1.26 earlier.Birlasoft has exited the F&O ban.Aarti Industries, Biocon, Chambal Fertilisers, GNFC, Granules India, LIC Housing, NALCO, Oracle Financial, PNB, RBL Bank and SAIL remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 25,000 and 25,850 saw Open Interest addition, while the 25,500 and 26,000 strike saw shedding in Open Interest for Thursday's monthly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes of 25,500 and 25,600 saw Open Interest addition, while the 22,500 strike also saw addition in Open Interest.",

The Nifty hit a record high in the early minutes of trade, even crossing 25,600 at one point and it seemed as if the Indian markets are cheering the Fed rate cut much louder than Wall Street did overnight.But similar to Wall Street's session on Wednesday, that is where the good part ended for Dalal Street as well. The index saw a bout of profit booking from the record high levels and even if it managed to end with gains, it corrected 200 points from the highest point. The weekly options expiry trade also came into effect on Thursday for the Nifty.The pain though, came from the broader markets. Both Nifty Midcap and Smallcap index fell for the third day in a row . A bad piece of news for Vodafone Idea dragged the stock 20% lower to its biggest single-day drop since January 2022 and also took Indus Towers along with it, which ended 9% lower.57 stocks on the Nifty Midcap index and 78 stocks on the Smallcap index ended the day with losses. PSUs continued to underperform with most state-run companies, barring NTPC, seeing losses between 1% to 5%.For the week so far, the Midcap index is down 1.1%, the Smallcap index is down nearly 2%, while the PSE index has already declined 2.5% and is set for its third straight weekly drop. The Nifty is up 0.2% so far on a weekly basis and needs to close above 25,356 to post gains for the week.Foreign investors were net buyers in the cash market on Thursday, while domestic institutions were net sellers.A small negative candle was formed on the daily chart with long upper shadow, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. This kind of pattern indicates false upside breakout of the range movement at 25,500 levels. He advises using dips towards 25,200 - 25,100 levels as a buying opportunity. Immediate resistance is at 25,600.LKP Securities' Rupak De said that the Nifty sentiment going forward may remain sideways to weak as long as the Nifty remains below the 25,550 - 25,600 range. On the lower end, support is at 25,350, below which the Nifty can fall to 25,100 - 25,000.Aditya Agarwal of Sanctum Wealth said that the Nifty will find immediate support around levels of 25,360 and a close below that may put further pressure on the index towards 25,160 levels. On the upside, 25,540 - 25,580 will act as a stiff resistance.It almost comes across as if the Nifty Bank is trading on a completely different planet. While other indices are struggling for momentum, the Nifty Bank has gained over 2,000 points in this six-day winning streak and came within four points of its previous record high on Thursday. In another positive sign, the index has closed above the mark of 53,000 and is up over 2% for the week after another 2.5% surge last week.The Nifty Bank has formed a shooting star candlestick pattern on the daily chart which indicates a decline in buying interest, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. He said that the high of this pattern, which is 53,350, will act as an immediate hurdle and advises a \"sell-on-rise\" strategy to short-term traders. Sustaining above that level can take the Nifty Bank to 53,500 - 53,800 levels. On the downside, 52,750, followed by 52,000 are support levels.Nifty 50's September futures shed 1.6% or 2.1 lakh shares in Open Interest on Thursday. They are now trading at a premium of 73.3 points from 18.55 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's September futures added 0.9% or 16,635 shares in Open Interest on Thursday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio now at 1.26 from 1.13 earlier.Chambal Fertilisers, NALCO, SAIL have entered the F&O Ban.Balrampur Chini is out of the F&O ban.Aarti Industries, RBL Bank, Granules India, Birlasoft, GNFC, LIC Housing, Biocon, PNB, Oracle Financial continue to remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 25,500 and 27,000 have seen Open Interest addition for next Thursday's monthly F&O expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 22,500 to 25,500 have seen Open Interest addition for next Thursday's monthly expiry.",

The market opened flat, scaled a new high, saw a sharp sell-off from the higher levels but eventually recovered to close near the flat line.The Nifty made a record high of 25,482 on Wednesday , but the bears ensured that the bulls do not get too complacent ahead of the Fed rate decision later tonight and the index corrected from higher levels, as much as 200 points at one point of time. Yet again, 25,300 emerged as a support on the downside, as the index recovered from the lows of 25,285.Its been four days now since the Nifty either saw gains or losses in excess of 0.1%. The range on Wednesday was 200 points but the outcome was similar to the last three trading sessions. The Nifty could not close above 25,400 but has not closed significantly below it either. Nifty's new record high of 25,482 will be the first key level to watch on the upside ahead of its weekly expiry session on Thursday.Even as the benchmark indices cooled off from the highs of the day, it was a painful day for India's IT companies as nearly all of them saw losses between 3% to as high as 10%. The Nifty IT index had its worst single-day drop in nearly two months. Along with IT names, even Pharma and Metal stocks witnessed selling pressure as most sectoral indices ended in the red.Fed Chair Jerome Powell has finally delivered a much anticipated 50 basis points rate cut. However, the US markets, after an initial pop, gave up all the gains to end lower on Wednesday. Thursday's moves on the Nifty may well determine whether 26,000 is a possibility for the index by the end of this series, which has one more weekly expiry to play out. The GIFT Nifty, as of now, is indicating a flat start for the Sensex and Nifty.Both foreign and domestic institutions were net buyers in the cash market on Wednesday.The short-term trend of the Nifty remains positive with rangebound action, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities, who believes that any dip towards 25,200 - 25,100 levels will be a buying opportunity. Any decisive upmove towards 25,500 will pull the Nifty to higher targets.Rupak De of LKP Securities said that Nifty has support on the downside at 25,300 and a slip below that level could drag it further down to 25,000 - 24,900 levels. On the upside, 25,500 is a resistance that the bulls may find difficult to conquer in the short-term.Sanctum Wealth's Aditya Agarwal said that the 25,500 strike Call option has seen aggressive writing and that will act as a stiff resistance for the Nifty. He advises booking profits at any move towards those levels. On the downside 25,250 is a strong support, below which, the Nifty can fall to 25,100.While nearly all sectoral indices sold-off on Wednesday, the one that stood tall was the Nifty Bank. The index cushioned the Nifty from the sell-off seen in IT stocks. Two of its biggest constituents, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank contributed equally to the index upside on its weekly expiry.In the process, ICICI Bank shares also hit a record high and crossed \u20b99 lakh crore in market capitalisation for the first time. The Nifty Bank is now just 250 points away from reclaiming the 53,000 mark and has gained over 1,600 points in the last five trading sessions.The Nifty Bank has formed a strong bullish candle on the daily chart indicating strength. However, Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates believes that the index may encounter some resistance near the psychological level of 53,000. In case the index manages to sustain above that level, then it may see potential upside towards 53,500 - 53,800 levels. On the downside, 52,000 and 51,700 can act as a support. Yedve advises using dips as a buying opportunity.Nifty 50's September futures shed 3.4% or 4.7 lakh shares in Open Interest on Wednesday. They are now trading at a premium of 18.55 points from 31.25 points earlier. On the other hand, the Nifty Bank's September futures shed 5% or 1 lakh shares in Open Interest on Thursday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 1.13 from 1.3 earlier.Oracle Financial Services has entered the F&O ban.Hindustan Copper is out of the F&O ban.Aarti Industries, Balrampur Chini, RBL Bank, Granules India, Birlasoft, GNFC, LIC Housing, Biocon and PNB remain in the F&O ban list.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 25,350 and 25,600 have seen Open Interest addition for Thursday's weekly expiry session.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,500 to 25,250 have seen Open Interest addition for Thursday's weekly expiry session.",

That should be enough comfort for the Nifty bulls, who are now positioning themselves for the outcome from the US Federal Reserve's policy decision.With lack of cues forthcoming from Wall Street and most Asian markets shut due to respective holidays, both Sensex and the Nifty are also choosing to bide time ahead of Jerome Powell and Co. embarking on a rate cutting cycle after nearly two-and-a-half years.Wall Street though, remains divided on whether the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points or by 50 basis points. According to the CME Group's Fed Watch tool, traders are pricing in more than 67% chance that the FOMC will ease by 50 basis points, a figure higher than the 47% chance on Friday.While Wall Street is a divided hours, a former New York Fed President believes that the FOMC should begin the easing cycle with a 50 basis points cut. He explains his rationale in this piece. But there was plenty of stock specific action that continued in the broader markets, even as the midcap and smallcap indices continued to sell-off. PSUs faced some selling pressure, but Bajaj Housing Finance, the stock of the week and perhaps the listing of the year, added another 10% to Monday's 135% pop from its IPO price. You can read more on that here. Ola Electric was another 10% upper circuit stock on Tuesday after two brokerages initiated coverage with \"buy\" recommendations and projected potential upsides of up to 50%. Wednesday will also be the weekly expiry of the Nifty Bank, that will continue to keep the now-outperforming sector in focus.Both foreign and domestic institutions were net buyers in the cash market on Tuesday. The numbers may be skewed due to block deals seen in stocks like Tata Motors, BLS International and Trent.After the decisive upside breakout last Thursday, the current rangebound action could be an indication of a breather pattern and such actions, more often than not, result in continuation of the uptrend, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. A sustained upmove above 25,450 - 25,500 can open the next upside target of 25,800 in the near-term, with immediate support being placed at 25,200 on the downside.Osho Krishnan of Angel One said that Nifty candle formation lacks conviction and hence a cautiously optimistic approach is warranted. 25,500 - 25,600 will be a significant hurdle for the bulls, while 25,300 - 25,200 will act as a buffer and can present an opportunity to strategically increase longs.The immediate support for the Nifty is at 25,350, below which there would be unwinding of Put options, potentially triggering a correction towards 25,000, said Rupak De of LKP Securities. On the upside, resistance is at 25,500 and a move above that can lead to strong upside.The Nifty Bank traded in a very narrow band on Tuesday but still managed a fourth straight day of gains, even as it could not hold on to levels of 52,300 on the upside. The index saw some selling pressure in the final few minutes of trade but managed to close above the flat line.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities expects the bullish momentum in the Nifty Bank to continue as its 20-DMA has crossed above its 50-DMA, forming a bullish crossover. He said that any short-term correction towards levels of 52,000, would present a buying opportunity.The Nifty Bank is sustaining well above the cup-and-handle breakout level of 51,750, indicating potential strength, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. The 51,700 - 51,750 zone may act as an immediate support for the Nifty Bank and if that holds, the index can test levels of 52,800 - 53,000 in the short-term.Nifty 50's September futures shed 1.9% or 2.7 lakh shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. They are now trading at a premium of 31.25 points from 59 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's September futures shed 3.7% or 76,965 shares in Open Interest on Tuesday.

However, the index has not managed to sustain at these levels but still closed above the flat line on Monday.The Nifty traded in a 110-point range on Monday and closed over 60 points off the highs of the day. The Nifty has now oscillated between gains and losses over the last five trading sessions.While the Nifty remained sluggish, the Nifty Bank emerged as the outperformer. The broader markets too ended with modest gains, although there was plenty of stock specific activity within the midcaps and the smallcaps.But the day belonged to Bajaj Housing Finance, which went down as one of the most successful listings in recent times. The IPO, priced at \u20b970, listed at \u20b9150, and eventually ended in an upper circuit at \u20b9165, up 135% from its IPO price. The market would like to take cues from how Wall Street behaves over the next two sessions, although it may not come as a surprise that the next two days also remain rangebound, ahead of the Fed rate decision, and also on account of the Ganpati Visarjan on Tuesday.Foreign institutions were net sellers in the cash market on Monday, while domestic institutions were net buyers. The numbers will be skewed on account of the block deals seen in stocks like Edelweiss, India Shelter Finance and EaseMyTrip.Vaishali Parekh of Prabhudas Lilladher said that the Nifty has been hovering near the 25,400 zone and the next target for the index is at 25,800 which the index can scale in the near-term. Support on the downside is seen at levels of 25,200.The Nifty technical chart showed no change in formation compared to Friday, meaning the trend remains strong, though with limited upward potential in the short-term, said Rupak De of LKP Securities. Support on the downside is seen between 25,150 - 25,200 levels, while resistance is seen between 25,460 - 25,500. A breakout from the range may indicate a directional move.HDFC Securities' Nagaraj Shetti said that the underlying uptrend remains intact for the Nifty and the index can eventually breakout from the current range and move towards the next hurdle of 25,800 in the near-term. Immediate support is at 25,150 levels.We mentioned earlier that the Nifty Bank emerged as the outperformer in Monday's trading session and the index has been doing so over the last three sessions. With Monday's move, the index has gained over 1,100 points over three trading sessions. The Nifty Bank also closed above the mark of 52,000 on Monday, the first time since July 22. Tuesday will also keep the index in focus as it will be the weekly expiry of the Nifty Financial Services index.The Nifty Bank's 20-Day Moving Average is set to cross the 50-Day Moving Average, which is considered a bullish crossover, indicating that the positive momentum is likely to continue, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. He sees immediate support for the Nifty Bank at 51,800, while resistance is now at 52,500 and 52,600 levels.Praveen Dwarkanath of Hedged.in said that the next immediate level to watch on the upside for the Nifty Bank is 52,700 and 53,500. The options for the present week's expiry shows selling in At-the-money Puts and short-covering in In-the-Money Calls, indicating that the bullishness may continue.Nifty 50's September futures shed 2.9% or 4.2 lakh shares in Open Interest on Monday. They are now trading at a premium of 59 points from a premium of 16.1 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's September futures shed 4.3% or 94,185 shares in Open Interest on Monday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio remains at 1.Birlasoft, GNFC, LIC Housing Finance are stocks that have entered the F&O Ban.Aarti Industries, Balrampur Chini, Bandhan Bank, Chambal Fertilisers, Hindustan Copper, RBL Bank and Granules India continue to remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 25,650 and 26,000 saw Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,600 and 25,400 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.",

While that can only be par for the course, it was nothing that would set alarm bells ringing among the market participants. The only ones whose alarm bells, panic bells, SOS calls were triggered on Thursday, were the bears.The Nifty remains comfortably perched above the 25,300 mark, even above the previous record high of 25,333. It ended last week with gains of close to 2% with the rally led mainly by largecap heavyweights.If one wondered that ahead of the all important US Federal Reserve rate decision would bring some uncertainty on Wall Street, it was not to be, at least on Friday. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq posted yet another day of gains to round off their best week of 2024. The S&P 500 is now less than 1% away from its record high levels that it hit this July.Friday's Wall Street sessions would give the bulls lots of confidence heading into the all important Fed rate decision week. Even though the rally seen on the indices has led to questions as to whether the Fed is even relevant in the scheme of things, but the commentary would definitely be relevant. Wall Street participants continue to debate whether the Fed will cut by 25 basis points or by 50. You can read more on the Fed's previous rate-cutting cycle, right here. Even as the benchmark indices took a breather on Friday, the broader markets continued to make merry. The Midcap index crossed the mark of 60,000, aided by a surge in Metal stocks and the beaten down PSU banks. Whether that continues in the new week or not, remains to be seen.Both foreign and domestic institutions were net buyers in the cash market on Friday. However, the numbers may be skewed due to the block deals seen in stocks like Jagsonpal Pharma, Edelweiss and Godrej Agrovet.Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One advises booking profits at higher levels to account for any potential volatility ahead of the Fed rate decision. For the Nifty, 25,200 will be an immediate support, while the strong support comes further down at 25,000 - 24,970 levels. On the upside, 25,500 - 25,600 can be an immediate hurdle.The short-term trend of the Nifty remains positive and has engulfed the long bear candle of the previous week on the weekly chart, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. A strong move above 25,400 can take the index to 25,800 levels on the near-term. Immediate support is seen at levels of 25,200.Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates' Hrishikesh Yedve believes that the Nifty has closed above the previous breakout point of 25,335, indicating strength. He advises a buy-on-dips strategy on the index, for potential short-term targets of 25,500 and 25,800. On the downside, support is seen at 24,980 levels.Nifty Bank turned out to be an outperformer on Friday as well, even as the Nifty saw some modest losses. The index has seen gains of nearly 1,000 points in the last two trading sessions. The Banking index also ended with gains of over 2% for the week. The gains were further supported by a reversal in PSU Banks, which have otherwise been underperformers. The index is now just 60 points away from the 52,000 mark, which it came within six-points to reclaiming on Friday, but reverse from those levels.Amol Athawale of Kotak Securities said that the Nifty Bank remaining above its 50-DMA or 51,350 levels, the bullish formation will continue. The next level on the upside is said to be 52,250 - 52,700. On the flip side, a slip below the 50-DMA will lead to traders exiting long positions.Nifty 50's September futures shed 1.6% or 2.3 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday. They are now trading at a premium of 16.1 points from a discount of 32.6 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's September futures added 0.4% or 9,465 shares in Open Interest. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1 from 1.43 earlier.Aditya Birla Fashion is out of the F&O ban.Aarti Industries, Balrampur Chini, Bandhan Bank, Chambal Fertilisers, Hindustan Copper, RBL Bank and Granules India are stocks still in the F&O ban.For next Thursday's weekly expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes between 25,400 and 26,500 have seen Open Interest addition.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,900 and 25,200 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry, while the 24,500 strike has seen Open Interest shedding.",

The first half is until 2 PM, and the second half post that. Post 2 PM, it was a one-way move for the market. Until then, the Nifty, which struggled to cross 25,000 for the better part of the day, crossed 25,200, 25,300 and even made a new record high of 25,433, all within a span of 90 minutes.The weekly options expiry of the Nifty 50 contracts triggered a sharp short covering move, led by banking stocks. Another trigger may have been the nearly \u20b93 lakh crore that were blocked for the Bajaj Housing Finance IPO. Freeing up of that capital could have also led to this upmove. You can read more on that here. All 50 Nifty constituents ended with gains on Thursday . The broad-based move was evident as the top three point contributors on the index - Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel and HDFC Bank, contributed to only 26% of the Nifty's gains. You can read more on the top Nifty gainers here. The rise in global metal prices aided the metal stock rally, while PSUs, including PSU Banks, the underperformers in recent times, saw some bit of relief coming in at lower levels. However, there were stock-specific losers in an otherwise frenzied market. Stocks like Granules India fell 16% on regulatory fears, while Honasa Consumer fell 5% after a large trade.With the index now in blue sky territory, it is difficult to determine the next levels of upsides for the index. Of course, Thursday's high of 25,433 will be the first level to watch. But the bulls will be determined to end the week on a high and take the Nifty past the 25,500 mark.For the week, the Nifty is now up over 2% and is poised for its best weekly performance since June. The index is also set to gain in four out of the last five weeks.Foreign institutions were heavy buyers in the cash market on Thursday, while domestic institutions chose to book some profits at higher levels.The sharp upside breakout on Thursday is indicating more upside for the market ahead, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. He said that the next upside level to watch will be 25,800 by next week. Immediate support is at 25,200 levels.Rupak De of LKP Securities said that the Nifty RSI on the daily chart shows a bullish crossover, reinforcing the positive sentiment. He expects the move to continue towards 25,470 - 25,500 levels, while support on the downside is at 25,100.Sanctum Wealth's Aditya Agarwal believes that the short-term Nifty view is bullish and dips towards 25,300 - 25,180 will be used to initiate fresh long positions. However, he expects some minor profit booking at levels of 25,500.It was the upmove in the Nifty Bank that first triggered the move on the Nifty before other heavyweights began to contribute to the rally. For an index, that was perched at the 51,000 levels on the downside before trading began on Thursday, saw a 750 point recovery from the day's low, and enroute, conquered all the resistance levels that were capping the index upside.For the week, the Nifty Bank too is up 2.2% and is set for its best week since June.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities said that the Nifty Bank is now displaying higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart and has stabilised above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. The support has now shifted to levels of 51,400, while the next leg of resistance comes in the 52,000 - 52,100 range.Nifty 50's September futures added 9.9% or 13.2 lakh shares in Open Interest on Thursday. They are now trading atg a discount of 32.6 points from a premium 20 points earlier. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.43 from 0.88 earlier.Granules India has now entered the F&O ban.Aarti Industries, Aditya Birla Fashion, Balrampur Chini, Bandhan Bank, Chambal Fertilisers, Hindustan Copper adn RBL Bank continue to remain in the ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 25,400 and 26,000 have seen Open Interest addition for next Thursdays weekly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 25,000 and 25,300 have seen Open Interest addition for next Thursday's expiry, while the 24,000 strike has also seen addition.were seen inwhose shares fell 16% on Thursday and itsincreased by 121%. Fresh short positions mean an increase in Open Interest but a decline in the price of a stock.",

Are the traders positioning themselves to use any bounce on the Nifty as a means to exit their positional longs? Well, something on similar lines played out on Wednesday as the Nifty witnessed selling pressure the moment it crossed 25,100 intraday.The index not only failed to defend the 25,000 mark, but at one point even broke below 24,900, before eventually closing above that mark after final adjustments. 24,800 on the downside and 25,100 on the upside has become the current range for the Nifty Even Gautam Shah of Goldilocks Premium Advisory told CNBC-TV18 on Wednesday that 25,150 is now a very important near-term barrier for the Nifty, that it needs to cross for further upside.Selling pressure came from all corners, be it Metals, Autos, PSU banks and even the entire CPSE basket, that continues to move lower from its August 1 peak. Even the midcap index, which was an outperformer till the start of the second half of the day, ended in the red.A negative handover from Wall Street though, may add to pressures on the downside. US CPI for August came in at 2.5%, which was the lowest since February 2021, while core CPI can be hotter than expected.This now brings us to some important questions for Thursday's trading session, which also happens to be the weekly expiry for the Nifty 50 options contracts:Both foreign and domestic institutions were net buyers in the cash market on Wednesday.Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One believes that in case Monday's support of the Nifty around 24,750 is broken, it could lead to further weakness towards levels of 24,500. On the slip side, 25,100 - 25,150 remains a strong resistance for now.The short-term Nifty trend remains rangebound to weak and a pullback move towards 25,050 - 25,100 should be used to exit from existing long positions, said Aditya Agarwal of Sanctum Wealth. On the downside, he sees support for the index around 24,880 and weakness below that can take the Nifty down to 24,750 levels.Kotak Securities' Shrikant Chouhan is of the view that a fresh bout of selling is possible on the Nifty only below the 20-DMA or below levels of 24,900 decisively, in case of which the index can fall to levels of 24,725. On the flip side, 25,000 will be a key level for the bulls.We have been highlighting this since the start of the week that the problem with indices like the Nifty Bank has been the lack of consistent follow-up buying and that showed in the price action in Wednesday's trading session as well.The Nifty Bank yet again tested 51,400 on the upside but succumbed to selling pressure as weekly expiry related jitters played out. The end result being that from testing 51,700 on the upside, the index is now on the verge of breaking 51,000 on the downside, something that the bulls may not want to happen.The Nifty Bank has strong support at the 50,500 mark on the downside, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities, but the index will have to close above 51,400 for the bullish momentum to return. PSU Banks continue to weigh on the index. In the short-term, he expects the Nifty Bank to remain rangebound within the 50,650 - 51,380 - 51,500 range.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty Bank has support near the 100-DEMA near 50,250 levels, while 51,400 - 51,420 acts as a short-term hurdle. Only a sustained move above 51,420 can take the Nifty Bank back to 51,800 - 52,000 levels.Nifty 50's September futures added 0.2% or 24,750 shares in Open Interest on Wednesday. They are now trading at a premium of 20 points from 41.9 points earlier. On the other hand, the Nifty Bank's September futures added 5% or 1.17 lakh shares in Open Interest on Wednesday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 0.88 from 1.07 earlier.Aarti Industries has entered the F&O ban, while Biocon is out of the ban.Aditya Birla Fashion, Balrampur Chini, Bandhan Bank, Chambal Fertilisers, Hindustan Copper and RBL Bank remain in the F&O ban list.For today's weekly expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes between 24,950 to 25,200 have seen Open Interest addition.On the Put side, while the Nifty 50 strikes of 24,700 and 24,850 have seen Open Interest addition for today's expiry, the 25,000 strike saw shedding in Open Interest.",

On a day when the street expected a repeat of Friday's declines courtesy of the sell-off on Wall Street, the Nifty ended higher. The Nifty ended higher on Tuesday as well, but then the gains were not as much as the street anticipated, considering the strong handover from across the Atlantic.The Nifty did cross 25,000 and even 25,100 intraday on Tuesday, but could not sustain above those levels. There was some resistance seen at the 25,150 mark, which led to the index turning from its intraday high of 25,130, and ended 90-points off the day's high.Nifty's price action almost makes it come across as if the bulls are treading every step with caution and not throwing caution to the wind. There is some very important data and events lined up in the next one week and they may want to take it easy for the time being. The US CPI and PPI data gets reported over Wednesday and Thursday, while the Federal Reserve's rate decision will also be announced next week.Tuesday's session belonged to IT and Pharma companies. A slew of brokerages have come out with notes on the future of the IT sector. You can read more on that here. Pharma companies also had a healthy day of gains, mainly due to the passage of the Biosecure Act in the US House of Representatives. The impact of the same on Indian Pharma companies can be read here.The next two sessions are crucial for the index. Wednesday will be the weekly expiry of the Nifty Bank, while the Nifty's weekly contracts expire on Thursday. Broader markets also staged a rebound after Monday's underperformance.Foreign Institutions were net buyers in the cash market on Tuesday, while domestic institutions were net sellers.Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One believes that the Nifty is facing the looming \"Bearish Engulfing\" pattern from last week. The current upward move is marked by small candles, which means traders should avoid complacency, he said. The Nifty appears to have entered a consolidation phase with 24,900 - 24,800 as support and 25,200 - 25,300 as resistance. He advises traders to adopt a buy-on-dips, sell-on-rallies strategy.Nifty faces a crucial resistance at 25,200 levels, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. A decisive move above this can open further upside towards new all-time highs with immediate support at 24,900, he added.LKP Securities' Rupak De said that the Nifty's RSI remained in a bearish crossover and he expects the sentiment to remain weak till the Nifty closes above 25,100. In case the Nifty slips below its support at 24,900, it may fall to levels of 24,750.The weekly expiry of the Financial Services index on Tuesday meant that the Nifty Bank continued to remain in the spotlight after Monday's upmove. The index tested levels of 51,400 on the upside, but could not sustain above those. However, it did manage to close above the 51,250 mark, which can be counted as a positive. Wednesday will also be an important session for the index as it will be its weekly expiry.The Nifty Bank manages to hold above the piercing line candle, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. In case the index manages to sustain above 51,400, he expects a move towards 51,800 - 52,000 in the short-term. On the downside, immediate support is at the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average at 50,950, followed by the low of the piercing line candle, which is at 50,370.Aditya Agarwal of Sanctum Wealth said that the Nifty Bank will continue to face resistance around 51,500 - 51,700 levels and it can see profit booking around those levels. He said that only a close above 51,800 will change the short-term outlook around the Nifty Bank and it can move towards 52,280 - 52,460 levels. 51,000 - 50,700 on the downside will see support.Nifty 50's September futures shed 3.1% or 4.25 lakh shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. They are now trading at a premium of 41.9 points from 48.6 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's September futures shed 07% or 15,465 shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.07 from 0.96 earlier.Aditya Birla Fashion, Balrampur Chini, Bandhan Bank, Biocon, Chambal Fertilisers, Hindustan Copper and RBL Bank continue to remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes of 25,050 and 25,100 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry, while the 25,000 and 24,900 strikes have seen shedding in Open Interest.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,800 and 25,100 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.",

Monday's price action does make it look as if Friday's damage on Wall Street was already factored in.On expected lines, the Nifty opened gap down , found support at the mentioned 24,750 - 24,760 zone, and reversed from those levels. The index recovered nearly 200 points from the lows of the day to end above the mark of 24,900 and although it could not manage to retest levels of 25,000, the fact that it closed at the day's high will give the bulls a good night's sleep.If someone thought of Monday's move to be unexpected, it has the banks and FMCG stocks to blame / thank, depending on which side of the spectrum you are on. Gains came from heavyweight banks like ICICI, HDFC Bank, which led the fall on Friday, and from FMCG giants like Hindustan Unilever, which ended with gains of over 3%.In fact, the Nifty FMCG index was the top sectoral gainer on Monday with all constituents of the index ending the session with gains, in what was an otherwise painful day for the broader markets.Even if the broader market indices recovered marginally from the lows of the day, they ended as underperformers compared to the Nifty. Pain continued within the PSU stocks, with the Nifty PSE index now having declined nearly 10% from its record high levels which it had hit on April 1. PSU Bank stocks also continued to move lower, as they did last Friday.Tuesday will also be the weekly expiry of the Nifty Financial Services index, which in turn, will keep the Nifty Bank in focus as well. Stocks will also see reaction depending on the outcome from the GST Council meeting, particularly those from the Metals, Real Estate and Insurance space.Even as the short-term trend of the Nifty is weak, the market has shown signs of sustainable upside recovery after a small downward correction, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. The index needs to sustain above levels of 25,150 on the upside, for a possible trend upwards. Downside support is at 24,750.Aditya Agarwal of Sanctum Wealth said that the short-term outlook for the market is weak and any Nifty pullback towards 25,000 - 25,080 levels should be used to book profits. A close below 24,750 may put added pressure on the index and drag it down to levels of 24,600 - 24,520.Kotak Securities' Shrikant Chouhan is of the view that till the Nifty remains above 24,800, this pullback formation is likely to continue up to 25,125 levels. On the downside, he advises exiting long positions on a close below 24,800 levels.The Nifty Bank has come to the Nifty's rescue more often than not in tricky situations as was the case on Monday as well. Barring HUL and ITC, most of the Nifty's contributors to the upside came from banking majors. Even as PSU banks underperformed, the large private banks drove the index back above the mark of 51,000 and also above its 20-Day Moving Average above levels of 50,900.However, the problem with the Nifty Bank has been the lack of follow-up buying action after a healthy upmove like the one seen on Monday.Even brokerages like Morgan Stanley wrote in a note that they would move away from PSU banks and veer towards large private lenders. It remains to be seen whether this pressure within PSU Banks continues in Tuesday's session as well.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty Bank's daily chart has formed a piercing line candle, indicating strength on the index. In case it manages to hold Monday's low of 50,370, a pullback move towards 51,500 - 51,800 on the upside cannot be ruled out in the short-term.Nifty 50's September futures shed 3.9% or 5.88 lakh shares in Open Interest on Monday. They are now trading at a premium of 48.6 points from 53.85 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's September futures shed 6.2% or 1.55 lakh shares in Open Interest. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 0.96 from 0.92 earlier.For this Thursday's weekly options expiry, the Nifty 50 strikes of 25,000 and 25,100 have seen Open Interest shedding, while the 24,950 strike have seen addition in Open Interest.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,700 and 24,900 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.",

Well, if Friday's price action is anything to go by, the answer would be a yes. But then Indian markets had their own reasons too, that may have triggered a sell-off, which resulted in the Nifty reporting its first weekly loss in four. Friday was also the first instance since August 23, when the Nifty closed below the mark of 25,000.Friday's decline though may just not be the end considering the steep fall that Wall Street witnessed after the August jobs report. The S&P 500 posted its worst week since March 2023, the Nasdaq Composite had its worst week in two years, while the Dow Jones also declined 3% for the week.The sell-off seen in the Nasdaq on Friday may also have a bearing on IT stocks, which have seen a significant run-up off late. Morgan Stanley, in a recent note said that the rally in these names is not done just yet and cited TCS, Infosys, and LTIMindtree as their top picks. But the actually selling pressure on Friday came from banks . The Nifty Bank fell nearly 1,000 points, while the PSU Bank index fell over 3%. Brokerages too are turning cautious on India's lenders. Morgan Stanley last week said it is time to turn selective on banks. Goldman Sachs too, downgraded SBI, India's largest lender, which led to a 4% drop in the stock, and took down other lenders with it as well.The Nifty now stands at a very critical support level of 24,850 on the downside. During Friday's fall, the index had managed to defend the 24,800 level on the downside and that will be the first line of defence for the index, in case of a gap-down start.Foreign institutions were net sellers in the cash market on Friday, while domestic institutions were net buyers. The numbers would be skewed due to the large block in Indigo Paints, where 25% equity had changed hands.Nifty has a weekly support at 24,770 levels, a break of which can take the Nifty down to levels of 24,350. It has created an engulfing candle on the weekly chart, indicating bearishness in the Nifty, said Praveen Dwarakanath of Hedged.in. On the weekly chart, the RSI divergence is evident, suggesting further downside. No significant writing was seen in In-The-Money Calls, indicating a possible halt of the fall at the weekly support of 24,770 levels, he added.Aditya Agarwal of Sanctum Wealth said that the Nifty will find strong support around levels of 24,760 and a break below that can drag the index further down towards levels of 24,600.Kotak Securities' Amol Athawale said that the Nifty has formed a long bearish candle on the intraday charts and its holding a lower top formation, which supports a further correction from the current levels. 24,820 is a key support from current levels but selling pressure may accelerate before that. On the flip side, only a move above 25,000 can take the index back to 25,100 - 25,150 levels.The declines in SBI, followed by a sell-off in ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and other constituents took the Nifty Bank down, not only below the 51,000 mark, but also towards a crucial support of 50,500. The Nifty Bank, which was an outperformer compared to the Nifty until Thursday's close, ended up an underperformer, ending the week with losses.Kotak Securities' Athawale believes that as long as the Nifty Bank trades below its 20-Day Moving Average, or the 51,000 mark, the weak sentiment is likely to continue. Below that, the index can fall to levels of 50,000 or even 49,600. Only above 51,000, the Nifty Bank can see a pullback rally towards 51,300 - 51,450 levels.Nifty 50's September futures shed 4.1% or 6.11 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday. They are now trading at a premium of 53.85 points from 91.65 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's September futures added 6.2% or 1.48 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio at 0.92 from 1.33 earlier.Aditya Birla Fashion, Balrampur Chini, Bandhan Bank, Biocon, Chambal Fertilisers, Hindustan Copper and RBL Bank are some stocks in the F&O ban.For Thursday's weekly options expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes between 24,900 and 25,200 have seen Open Interest addition.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,800 and 24,900 have seen Open Interest addition for Thursday's expiry.",

A gap-up start that defied otherwise mixed to negative global cues, could not sustain at higher levels. Over Wednesday and Thursday, the Nifty has made attempts to retest levels of 25,300 but has failed on both instances.The fact that the index has closed near the lowest point of the day will not please the bulls either. It was Reliance Industries that saw some selling pressure even after the board approved its 1:1 bonus issue.The losses in Reliance were offset by some buying interest seen in IT majors Infosys and Wipro, along with other heavyweights like HDFC Bank and ITC. Titan ended as the top contributor to the Nifty upside on Thursday.All eyes are now on two very important macro data points that may determine the index trajectory for the upcoming week, ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting on September 17-18. The first is the initial jobless claims which fell to 2,27,000, which is a decline from the previous week's tally of 2,32,000. Then of course, the all important non-farm payrolls data, which will be released on Friday. That has definitely kept the street on the edge, without any decisive moves.For the week, the Nifty is currently down by 90 points and needs to close above levels of 24,235 to prevent a first weekly drop in four weeks.Foreign institutions were net sellers in the cash market on Thursday, while domestic institutions were net buyers.Nifty sentiment remains indecisive and a clear directional trend may not emerge as long as the Nifty remains between this 25,100 - 25,200 range, said Rupak De of LKP Securities. A decisive move above 25,200 can take the index towards 25,350 or even 25,500. Support on the downside is at 25,080 - 24,950, he added.Aditya Agarwal of Sanctum Wealth expects the Nifty to continue consolidating between 25,060 - 25,300 levels before a breakout on either side. A close below 25,050 may weaken the near-term sentiment and may drag the index to levels of 24,900 - 24,820 levels, he said.HDFC Securities' Nagaraj Shetti said that the short-term Nifty trend is choppy with a weak bias and further weakness from these levels could find support around 25,000 - 24,900 levels before a sustainable bounce from the lows. Immediate resistance is at 25,300 levels.The Nifty Bank too opened gap-up on Thursday, but similar to the Nifty, could not hold on to its gains. However, some buying in HDFC Bank ensured that the index at least ended in the green. On a closing basis, the Nifty Bank has reached levels not seen in at least the last one month. For the week, the Nifty Bank has emerged as an outperformer, currently trading with gains of 0.2%.Technically, on the daily chart, the Nifty Bank has formed a small red candle, indicating selling pressure at higher levels, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. As long as it remains above the 50-DMA levels of 50,950, he recommends a \"buy-on-dips\" strategy on the index, suggesting an upside towards levels of 52,000, which coincides with the target of the double bottom pattern the index has formed.The Nifty Bank remains in a 51,240 - 51,750 range and is in a neutral stance, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. On the hourly chart, he expects an upward move if the index crosses 51,580, but until then, he expects the index to continue consolidating in the current range.Nifty 50's September futures shed 2.3% or 3.6 lakh shares in Open Interest on Thursday. They are now trading at a premium of 91.65 points from 49.1 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's September futures shed 1.6% or 38,595 shares in Open Interest on Thursday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 1.33 from 1.08 earlier.Bandhan Bank, Biocon and Chambal Fertilisers have entered the F&O ban, along with Aditya Birla Fashion, Balrampur Chini, Hindustan Copper and RBL Bank, which remain in the ban.For next week's weekly expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes between 25,200 and 25,500 have seen Open Interest addition.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes of 25,000 and 25,200 have seen Open Interest addition for next Thursday's weekly expiry, but the 24,200 and 24,500 strikes too have seen addition in Open Interest.",

Wednesday's session finally brought to an end the 14-day rally, as Dalal Street sold off in-line with the meltdown seen in global equity markets overnight.However, the decline on Wednesday was nowhere as significant as that seen either on Wall Street on Tuesday night or across the Asia-Pacific on Wednesday morning. It can go down as just another day in the office where the index saw some profit booking at higher levels after having had a non-stop run in one direction.Whether one would even want to call the price action on Wednesday as profit booking is debatable. The Nifty recovered more than 100 points from the lows of the day as the index found support just below 25,100 and reversed from those levels.Of course, a lot will depend on how Wall Street moves overnight ahead of the all important jobs data on Friday. Thursday is also the weekly expiry for the Nifty, its first for the September series and that will also have a part to play in the index moves.Regardless of the external factors, 25,000 remains a very crucial level for the Nifty on the downside. That is a level echoed by most chartists on the street. The Nifty has not closed below the 25,000 mark since August 23. On the upside, of course, the recent high of 25,333 becomes the first key level to cross, but with strong Call writing seen at 25,200 and the 25,300 strike, that will be a challenge for the bulls to conquer.Domestic cues are lacking but stock and sector specific moves continue, particularly within the broader markets. The US market sell-off dragged IT lower on Wednesday, which can also be in-line after the run-up seen recently, while Metals turned out to be a drag after fresh economic woes arose out of China.Both foreign and domestic investors were net buyers in the cash market on Wednesday.Aditya Agarwal of Sanctum Wealth expects the Nifty to trade in a broad range of 25,100 - 25,340 for the next few sessions before giving a fresh breakout. He advises using the dip towards 25,140 - 25,100 to be used in initiating fresh long positions for short-term targets of 25,300 - 25,350.The recent fall could be seen as a breather with no alterations to the ongoing trend, said Osho Krishnan of Angel One. He believes that 25,100 - 25,080 is an immediate support for the Nifty, followed by the key support at 25,000. On the upside, 25,300 and the record high levels will act as a resistance and only a break above that can open up the next leg of upside towards 25,400 - 25,500.LKP Securities' Rupak De believes that the Nifty might consolidate between 25,080 and 25,250 for the time being and a fall below 25,080 can trigger further downside towards 24,800 - 24,750 levels. However, a move above 25,236 may trigger a move towards higher levels, he added.Wednesday's price action on the Nifty Bank almost feels like status quo being restored as the index gave up all the gains it had made during Tuesday's trading session. Yet, it remains the index to watch out for over the last two trading sessions as it remains above the key support of 51,250 and closed exactly at the mark of 51,400.The Nifty Bank is currently showcasing a mixed trend, having closed above its 20-DMA but below its 50-DMA. The consistent appearance of Doji candlesticks on the daily charts indicates indecision in the market, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. The key support is at 51,000, with resistance at 51,800.Nifty 50's September futures added 1.2% or 1.82 lakh shares in Open Interest on Wednesday. They are now trading at a premium of 49.1 points from 74.7 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's September futures added 2% or 46,650 shares in Open Interest on Wednesday.

A solitary point. That is after a 250-point rally on the Nifty Bank. On paper, it becomes the 14th straight day of gains for the index. But it also begs the question, has the Nifty finally reached breaking point on the upside, at least for the time being?It was an 80-point range that the Nifty traded in on Tuesday. Not once did it show any signs of moving any higher from the previous record high that it had made. It opened above 25,300 but that was about it.Morgan Stanley wrote a note earlier in the day, where it highlighted two fundamental and two technical factors that can trigger a correction in the market. You can read more on that here. The Nifty Bank though was the star of the show on Tuesday. The index saw a spurt in the final few minutes of the trading session on Tuesday courtesy of the Nifty Financial Services weekly expiry. The 250-point surge not only took the index past 51,500 but also placed at the cusp of 51,700 on the upside.\"When it comes to the banking index, it's not yet a breakout. 51,960 is an important resistance. Once that's taken out, we're probably looking at fresh record highs to about 54,000. So watch out for 51,960. The lift is coming mainly from ICICI Bank, but other than that, most of the banking needs more action,\" said Jai Bala of cashthechaos.com.The Nifty Bank will also be in focus on Wednesday as it will be its weekly expiry.But what about the Nifty? Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities remains optimistic, saying that this rangebound action will eventually result in an upside breakout of 25,400 over time. A decisive move above that will take the Nifty to 25,800 levels.Rupak De of LKP Securities said that there is very strong Call writing at 25,300, and only a decisive move above that can take the Nifty to 25,500. On the downside, support is at 25,200 and 25,000.Both Foreign and domestic institutions were net buyers in the cash market on Tuesday.Nifty 50's September futures added 0.8% or 1.14 lakh shares in Open Interest on Tuesday.

The last time it had done so was back in 1993, when many of the current market participants were not even born or were mumbling incoherent words. The index has now nearly recovered 4,000 points from the July 23 low of 21,281, which was the day of the Union Budget.Friday turned out to be a strange session. Most of the MSCI related stocks, particularly HDFC Bank, instead of moving higher when the adjustments took place, ended up seeing a strong bout of profit booking. HDFC Bank fell close to a percent, Vodafone Idea fell 5%, while Dixon Tech also ended with losses of 2%.HDFC Bank, which could have taken the Nifty higher on Friday, could not do so, but yet, the index managed a new record high of 25,268 and managed to close near the 25,250 mark, despite the selling pressure seen in HDFC Bank.September will be a big month for the global markets. With earnings season still a month away, all eyes will be on the US Federal Reserve as to whether Jerome Powell and team will finally bite the bullet and begin the next rate-cutting cycle starting September 17-18.Geopolitical tensions will be the other major factor to watch out for, whether tensions between Hezbollah-Israel-Iran escalate or a much awaited ceasefire is finally agreed upon. The resultant impact on crude oil prices and its after-effects on oil sensitives will also be watched out for.The first week of the month will also see reactions in auto stocks for their monthly sales figures, PSUs for their business updates and other macro data like the manufacturing and services Purchasing Managers Index.For the week, the Nifty ended with gains of 1.6%, which turned out to be its third straight weekly advance. During Friday's trading session, foreign institutions were net buyers in the cash market, largely due to the MSCI adjustments, while domestic institutions were net sellers.Amol Athawale of Kotak Securities said that the Nifty is holding on to the higher bottom formations on the daily charts, which is largely positive. 25,000 will now act as a key support for day traders, above which the index can see some resistance between 25,350 and 25,500. He advises exiting from long positions in case the Nifty falls below 25,000.The short-term trend of the Nifty, though positive, is not able to gather sharp upside momentum to new highs. He expects further consolidation or minor dip on the Nifty from the resistance of 25,300 - 25,400 levels. The immediate downside support is at 25,100.The Nifty Bank, despite its struggles at higher levels is continuing to grind higher. The index crossed the 51,450 mark intraday on Friday but could not sustain above it due to the selling pressure seen in HDFC Bank. It still managed to post its third straight weekly advance and close above the mark of 51,350. It has now also gained in four out of the last five trading sessions. The index is now at a one-month high, having last closed above these levels on August 2.The Nifty Bank has stabilised above the mark of 51,050, which is the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level and is now holding above its 40-Day Exponential Moving Average, with the daily Relative Strength Index now at levels of 55. The support has now shifted higher to 50,950 levels, while the 100-point range between 51,750 - 51,850 range is a key resistance for the index.Nifty 50's September futures added 5.2% or 6.9 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday. They are now trading at a premium of 141 points from 113.25 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's September futures shed 1.5% or 34,845 shares in Open Interest on Friday.

The 11th day of gains during its monthly expiry session was courtesy Reliance Industries, which we at CNBC-TV18 had suggested as to whether the stock could put its hand up and lead the Nifty higher. One-third of the Nifty's gains on Thursday came from Reliance Industries.An otherwise sluggish session on the Nifty was brought to life when Reliance Industries announced that it will consider a 1:1 bonus issue at its board meet on September 5. The resultant spike saw the Nifty make a new high of 25,192 before ending at a record closing high of 25,151.Once the Nifty crosses the level of 25,281 on the upside, it would mean a recovery of 4,000 points from the Union Budget low of 21,281.The Nifty, for the August series, ended with gains of over 300 points, marking its third consecutive F&O series. For the week, the Nifty is up 1.2% and is poised for its third straight weekly advance.A big factor for Friday's trading session though, will be the MSCI adjustments, which will take place in the final few minutes of the trading session. This means that HDFC Bank, which has been an underperformer, will see the first tranche of its weightage increase in the MSCI indices. Analysts are expecting the lender to receive flows ranging between $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion.Both foreign and domestic investors were net buyers in the cash market on Thursday but the numbers will also be skewed due to the block deals seen in stocks like InterGlobe Aviation, PB Fintech and Welspun Living.A long bull candle has been formed on the Nifty's daily chart at the new highs, indicating that the index is preparing for a decisive upside breakout of the 25,100 hurdle, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. He sees 25,360 - 25,400 to be the next upside level for the Nifty, while 25,000 will be an immediate downside support.Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One advises maintaining a positive bias on the index is the Nifty remains above the mark of 25,000. Only a break below that level can take the Nifty down to 24,850 levels. He expects the gains to extend in the near-term if the key support levels are held.Kotak Securities' Shrikant Chouhan said that the larger market texture is positive but due to the temporary overbought conditions, the trading may remain rangebound in the near future. 25,000 is a key support on the downside, above which he expects a move towards 25,225 - 25,300 levels, while on the flip side, a fall below 25,000 will take the Nifty down to 24,850.The Nifty Bank is stuck in a range yet again. It is unable to muster enough strength to close above the 51,250 - 51,350 range. But that may change on Friday in case the index trades positive and then gets a boost courtesy the MSCI adjustment flows for HDFC Bank. Despite a volatile week, the index is still up 0.4% so far on a weekly basis and in case it manages a close above 50,933 levels, it will be the third straight positive week for the banking index as well.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities continues to maintain that the Nifty Bank indicators, including the MACD and the RSI suggest that the index may break its significant resistance mark of 51,500 soon and move higher. 50,950 on the downside, followed by 50,770 will be key supports in case of a pullback. But a move above 51,500 will swiftly take the index to 52,000.",

That has been the market trajectory since the start of the year. After days of consolidating and resisting, the Nifty conquered its previous record high of 25,078 a day ahead of its August F&O expiry and made a new high of 25,129.As has been the case with previous highs, there was some bit of profit booking at higher levels and that resulted in the Nifty seeing a 90-point drop from the highs of the day, ending even below its previous record high of 25,078. Nonetheless, the index gained for the 10th day in a row, in what has turned out to be its longest winning streak since September-October, 2020.This surge has come despite the underperformance from banking stocks as the day belonged to IT stocks. Barring Tata Elxsi, which sold-off after a stellar two-day move, most largecap or midcap IT names saw healthy gains in Wednesday's trading session.The 10-day surge on the Nifty has meant that the index has turned positive for the August expiry. Another positive day or a close above levels of 24,834 would mean a third consecutive positive F&O series for the Nifty, after the 400-odd points that it gained in July and the 1,556-point surge it saw in the June series.But the big question for Thursday's trading session is that will Reliance Industries, the index heavyweight, put its hand up and lead the Nifty to an 11th straight day of gains on its monthly expiry session? That came after the Competition Commission of India approved the proposed merger between Reliance Industries, Viacom18, Digital18 Media, Star India and Star Television Productions Ltd.The stock has been trading lower for the last two trading sessions and also closed below the mark of \u20b93,000 on Wednesday. Reliance Industries will also be in focus on Thursday ahead of its all important Annual General Meeting where more clarity is expected on the path ahead for the company's various businesses.The underlying Nifty trend remains positive and further consolidation or a minor dip from here may create the space for a decisive upside breakout from the resistance at 25,100, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. He sees upside targets of 25,360 post the breakout as per the Fibonacci extension. Immediate downside support is between 24,800 - 24,750.Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One though believes that while there is some fatigue in the bullish momentum, it does not indicate a reversal of the uptrend. He advises maintaining a positive bias, albeit selectively, buy intraday dips and consider timely profit booking. Key levels for the monthly expiry are 25,150 - 25,240, while 25,000 can act as a support.LKP Securities' Rupak De said that the Nifty remains confused at higher levels, indicating indecisiveness, as indicated by two consecutive doji-like candles, post the recent rally on the daily charts. A close above 25,100 could confirm a further upmove but the lack of sustained buying may trigger some selling pressure, for which the downside support is at 24,800.There was one positive for the Nifty Bank despite the choppy moves that it had been exhibiting all through the August series, and that was the fact that it had been exhibiting higher highs on the daily charts for the last eight trading sessions. That too ended on Wednesday as the index could not test levels of 51,400 on the upside, which was Tuesday's high. The index only traded in a 250-point range and even closed below the mark of 51,250, ending its August series on a negative note.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities sees a slowdown in the bullish momentum for the Nifty Bank as it is breaching lower swings in the hourly candles. To bring the momentum back into the index, it needs to close above levels of 51,500. In case the index slips below 51,000, it can see a fall towards 50,770 levels and fill the gap created on August 22, he added. He expects the Nifty Bank to remain non-directional for now with a 50,750 - 51,500 range.Nifty 50's futures added 11% in Open Interest across series, with current rollovers at 23%. Nifty Bank's futures added 65% in Open Interest across series. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 1.21 from 1.22 earlier.Bandhan Bank, Granules India and Hindustan Copper have entered the F&O ban ahead of series expiry day.Aarti Industries, Aditya Birla Fashion, Birlasoft, Chambal Fertilisers, IEX and RBL Bank are out of the F&O Ban.India Cements continues to remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 25,000 and 25,200 have seen addition in Open Interest for this Thursday's monthly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,900 and 25,100 have seen addition in Open Interest for this Thursday's monthly expiry.",

But with domestic cues lacking, the onus lies on the global markets to ensure that the mood on Dalal Street remains upbeat.It almost feels as if the US markets have completely discounted the fact that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September and may be more before the end of the year. The US market rally stretched into the eighth straight day on Monday and the bulls will not mind adding another day to that tally either.24,650 was the level that the Nifty had to cross on Tuesday and it did so. It has now entered the key resistance band between 24,750 and 24,850, which will open the doors to new highs in case of a convincing breakout from those levels. The Nifty did test 24,750 on the upside on Tuesday but closed 50 points off those levels. But closing near the day's high will definitely be a confidence booster for the bulls.The broader markets too moved in tandem with the benchmark indices but not all pockets did well. Pressure was seen in defence stocks, particularly in shipbuilding names like Mazagon Dock and Garden Reach, which fell up to 9%. You can read more on that here. Some of the high-flyers on Monday like CAMS, Caplin Point among others also saw bouts of profit booking.However, shares of Angel One gained 14% on Tuesday, extending its winning run to the fourth straight day. The stock has now risen 25% in the last four trading sessions. More on that here. Foreign institutions were net sellers in the cash market on Tuesday, while domestic institutions continued to remain net buyers.A small positive candle was formed on the Nifty's daily chart and the index is making an attempt to break above the key opening downside gap of 24,686, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. The Nifty has closed slightly above that level and will look to sustain above the same. Shetti further said that the underlying trend is positive and a sustained move above 24,700 will open further upsides towards 25,000 and 25,100. Immediate downside support is at 24,500Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities said that 24,650 and 24,575 are key levels on the downside for the Nifty and 24,800 - 24,835 is a key resistance zone. He advises day traders to adopt a buy-on-dips and sell-on-rallies strategy.LKP Securities' Rupak De believes that the trend favours the Nifty bulls till the index remains above 24,300 levels. On the upside, resistance is seen between 24,750 - 24,800 levels.For a very brief period, the Nifty Bank crossed the 51,000 mark on Tuesday but could not sustain above the same. Tuesday's rally was led by HDFC Bank with other banking constituents also participating in the upside. With Wednesday being the weekly expiry for the index, it will be interesting to see whether the retest of the 51,000 mark translates into a more meaningful upmove for the index that has been an underperformer.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities said that the market outlook has turned bullish with the Nifty Bank breaking out from its trading range and the downward sloping channel. The index has closed above its 20-Day Exponential Moving Average after 20 trading sessions and that further supports the momentum. A sustained move above 51,000 may lead to sellers unwinding their positions further.The Nifty Bank formed a green candle on the daily chart indicating strength, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates.

At least on Monday. Buoyed by strong global cues, the index opened gap-up on expected lines. However, the gap-up could not sustain.Although the Nifty ended flat on Monday , it did so with modest gains, building on Friday's over 300-point rally. The index has now rallied over 400 point rally in the last three trading sessions, which may have resulted in the bulls facing some exhaustion at higher levels.The other reason that may have kept the bulls quiet on Monday is the underperformance of banking stocks and the data-heavy week that lies ahead, including the Jackson Hole Symposium where Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak and before that, the minutes of the recent Fed meeting.While the Midcap index remained subdued through the session, there was plenty of activity within the smallcap names, particularly the capital market-linked names like CDSL, CAMS, Angel One, which saw gains between 5% to 10%. The new-listings like Ola Electric and Unicommerce eSolutions continued to surge as well. Ola Electric has now nearly doubled from its IPO price of \u20b976, while Unicommerce too ended at a 20% upper circuit.Foreign institutions returned to being net sellers in the cash market on Friday, while domestic institutions were net buyers.Osho Krishnan of Angel One believes that the Nifty continues to hover within the bearish gap on the daily charts and that 24,700 is likely to be the next important resistance for the index, followed by 24,800 and 24,850. On the downside, the 20-Day Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) of 24,390 will act as a strong support.The short-term trend of the Nifty remains positive but there is a resistance at 24,700 which may lead to some more consolidation or a minor dip before another upside breakout, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. Immediate downside support is at 24,400.Kotak Securities' Shrikant Chouhan says that a fresh upmove on the Nifty is possible only if the index crosses 24,650 on the upside, post which it can see a move towards levels of 24,775. On the downside, 24,520 will be a key intraday support, below which, levels of 24,400 could be tested.The Nifty Bank has been the key reason why the Nifty has either underperformed or its upside has been kept in check. The index traded in a 450-point range on Monday but managed to hold on to the 50,000 mark on the downside. It continues to face resistance at the 50,800 mark, as it reversed from an intraday high of 50,728, which emerged as a result of the early gap-up. With Tuesday being the Financial Services expiry, the index will continue to remain in focus and determine the Nifty trajectory to a large extent.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty Bank needs to see a sustained move above levels of 50,830, which will open doors for further upside towards levels of 51,200 - 51,500. Until then, he expects the index to consolidate within the 49,650 - 50,830 band.The Nifty Bank momentum remains neutral to positive as per its hourly charts, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. The RSI is showing a positive divergence and a move beyond 50,750 can take it to levels of 51,100 - 51,200.Nifty 50's August futures shed 2.9% or 3.3 lakh shares in Open Interest on Monday. They are now trading at a premium of 23.1 points from 44.3 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's August futures added 2.8% or 81,690 shares in Open Interest.

They did, and how!For the last eight trading sessions, the Nifty has struggled to cross the resistance range of 24,350 - 24,500 despite positive global cues as corporate earnings, along with the underperformance of some heavyweights like HDFC Bank, kept a lid on the index upside. All of that came to an end on Friday.The Nifty not only broke above the 24,350 mark, but did it decisively, crossing 24,400 and even 24,500, eventually closing near the mark of 24,550. Friday's upmove also ensured that the Nifty did not have to see a third straight weekly loss, as it managed to post healthy gains for the week.Until 11 AM on Friday, it felt like a similar story was unfolding as the Nifty struggled to cross 24,350 , even falling to a low of 24,200 on the downside, but staged a swift reversal in the second half of the trading session.With earnings season now having ended for the quarter, the focus has shifted back to global cues and to the US Federal Reserve. Wall Street has remained sanguine after the sell-off witnessed on August 5, with the benchmark indices there staging a dramatic reversal from the lows as well.All three indices on Wall Street - the Dow Jones, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 ended with gains on Friday. The S&P 500 gained nearly 4% for the week and had its best weekly performance since November 2023. The Nasdaq too ended with gains of nearly 6% as tech stocks too saw buying interest at lower levels.At the start of the new trading week, which is the penultimate one before the monthly F&O expiry, the bulls would not only want to defend 24,500 on the downside but also take the index further higher, back to the mark of 25,000 and past its recent record high of 25,078. Whether that does happen or the Nifty witnesses a false breakout and sees a bout of profit booking remains to be seen.After days of relentless selling, the foreign institutions were net buyers in the cash market on Friday, while domestic institutions too remained net buyers in larger quantities.Amol Athawale of Kotak Securities said that the 24,400 - 24,300 band will now act like a key support for the Nifty, above which, the bullish formation is likely to continue towards 24,650 - 24,750 zone. The uptrend will only be vulnerable below 24,300.A long bull candle was formed on Nifty's daily chart on Friday, which indicates that the Nifty is likely to fell the downgap of August 5 closer to 24,700 levels, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities, who added that it will be the key level to watch for the near-term, followed by 25,000. Immediate support is at 24,350.Angel One's Rajesh Bhosale said that the Nifty has more fuel on the upside having closed above its 20-Day Exponential Moving Average. He said that the Nifty can even retest levels of 25,000 if global markets remain supportive. On the downside, the bullish gap around 24,200 holds the key and he advises a buy-on-dips approach on the index.The Nifty Bank closed above the 50,500 mark on Friday for the first time after August 1 post a near-800-point rally. That was one of the key levels for the index on the upside, which was on the verge of breaking below 49,700 for most parts of the week. The surge on Friday made sure that the Nifty Bank managed to close just above the previous Friday, which was 50,484.The Nifty Bank remains within the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement range of 49,700 on the downside and 50,600 on the upside, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. The index has formed a \"double-bottom\" on the daily charts, indicating that a move above 50,750, will take the index back to levels of 51,200 and even 51,500 in the coming sessions.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates believes that the Nifty Bank has formed a green candle on the daily chart but may see some resistance near 50,805, where the 21-day Exponential moving Average is positioned. He sees a sustained move above 50,810 to propel the index to 51,200 - 51,500 going forward.Nifty 50's August futures shed 2% or 2.4 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday. They are now trading at a premium of 44.35 points from 30 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's August futures shed 12.9% or 4.4 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday.

A 100-point range on Wednesday meant that the index could not even reach 24,300 but it did test 24,100 on the downside and managed to respect those levels and close above that, near the mark of 24,150.24,100 does remain key for the Nifty on the downside going into the final trading day of the truncated week. For the week, the Nifty is now down 0.8% and is on course for its third straight weekly loss, a streak that it has not seen since July-August of last year.In order to prevent that, the bulls will have to ensure the Nifty closes above 24,367, which is above the 24,350 range that the Nifty has struggled to cross in recent times.With earnings season now coming to an end, the focus will shift back to valuations and of course, global cues. With the US CPI print coming in better-than-expected yet again, it has become all but certain that the US Federal Reserve will indeed cut interest rates in September, but the question now is, by how much?The US markets ended higher on Wednesday and the Indian equities will have two days of market reactions to focus on once trading resumes on Friday.Foreign institutions continued to remain net sellers in the cash market on Friday, while domestic institutions remained net buyers.Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One describes the Nifty trading range to be between 23,900 and 24,500 with 24,000 as a support and 24,350 as a key barrier for the index and a significant move can be seen only on breaking either end. The He advises avoiding complacent bets and remain stock specific.The immediate support of the ascending trendline has been broken on the downside by the Nifty and a significant downside gap of August 5 remains unfilled, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities, adding that this is a negative indicating. He further said that a move below 23,900 can trigger a significant downward correction. Immediate upside resistance is between 24,250 - 24,300.Kotak Securities' Shrikant Chouhan said that the current market texture is non-directional and that 24,215 is the key upside level for day traders, above which, a move towards 24,300 is possible. But the selling pressure may intensify if the index slips below 24,050, which can take it down to 23,900 or even 23,840 on the downside.Similar to the Nifty, the Nifty Bank has also been respecting levels, even as the index struggled to cross the mark of 50,000 on the upside. However, it managed to close above the very crucial 49,700 mark, a level below which the index has not closed since June 4. That level will continue to remain the key for the bulls to defend. For the week, the Nifty Bank continues to be the underperformer, currently down 1.5% and set for a second straight week of declines, unless it manages a close above levels of 50,500 on Friday.Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said that the Nifty Bank outlook remains weak and to trigger a short-term pullback, the index will have to sustain above 50,600. He advises a sell-on-rise strategy with the overall trend remaining downward and the index trading below its key moving averages.The Nifty Bank formed a red candle on the daily charts indicating continued weakness but continues to find support near the 49,650 - 49,660 levels, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. A sustained move below 49,650 can take the index below levels of 49,000.Nifty 50's August futures shed 3.9% or 4.67 lakh shares in Open Interest on Wednesday. They are now trading at a premium of 30 points compared to a premium of 22 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's August futures added 3% or 98,160 shares in Open Interest on Wednesday.

It sort of did, but on the wrong side.One may wonder that HDFC Bank was anticipated to get a weightage increase at the latest MSCI rejig. It did. So what went wrong? Well, the street wanted the weightage to be increased in one go, but MSCI decided to increase it in two tranches. The first one now, and the second in November, subject to compliance with the foreign headroom limit.That did not please the market participants. HDFC Bank's shares were already down 11% from the July 3 peak and Tuesday saw another 3% drop. 50% of the Nifty's fall on Tuesday came from India's largest private lender. The Nifty yet again faced pressure above 24,350 and swiftly reversed from those levels, once HDFC Bank continued to decline.Besides HDFC Bank, SBI, ITC and Bajaj Finance also contributed to the Nifty fall on Tuesday, albeit in a lesser quantum compared to the index heavyweight.Wednesday will now be the weekly expiry for both Nifty and the Nifty Bank as Thursday will be a market holiday on account of Independence Day and the Parsi New Year.For the weekly expiry session, 24,100 becomes the key level on the downside for the Nifty. Tuesday's low of 24,117 is the same as last Thursday's close so that will be the first level to watch. The fact that the Nifty has closed near the lowest point of the day will not please the bulls. A little far away is of course last Monday's swing low of 23,890, which will be another key level.Wednesday's trading session will see the final bits of earnings reactions from stocks like Hero MotoCorp, Apollo Hospitals, Manappuram Finance, Muthoot Finance, SJVN, MTAR Technologies among others.Foreign institutions continued to remain net sellers in the cash market on Tuesday, while domestic institutions continued to be net buyers.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said that a long negative candle was formed on the Nifty's daily chart and that has moved below the immediate ascending trend line support of 24,300. He added that the recent high of 24,472 seems to be a lower top for the Nifty and a slide below 24,000 - 23,900 levels can trigger a reasonable downward correction. 24,350 on the upside remains a resistance.It now appears as if the Nifty will test the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average support of 24,040 - 24,000 and potentially dip below the recent low of 23,900, said Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One. He advises keeping positions light and prepare for market fluctuations. 24,350 - 24,500 remains a key hurdle and only a move beyond that will favour the bulls.Kotak Securities' Shrikant Chouhan said that a reversal formation and a bearish candle on the daily charts indicates further weakness from current levels. 24,000 will be the trend decider for the day traders, below which the selling pressure could accelerate towards 23,850 - 23,775 levels.A fall like Tuesday's in shares of HDFC Bank was bound to reflect on the Nifty Bank index as well. Adding to that was the weekly expiry of the financial services index. The Nifty Bank failed to hold on to 50,000 but has clinging on to the lower end of the range around the 49,750 mark from which it saw a marginal recovery by the close of the session, only marginal.The index goes into Wednesday's weekly expiry by first looking to reclaim 50,000 on the upside and if not, protect 49,700 on the downside, a level it has not closed below since June 4, the day the Lok Sabha Election results were declared.The Nifty Bank continues to oscillate between 49,700 on the downside and 50,600 on the upside, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. With the daily RSI at 36, it is suggesting a weaker trend but also indicating that the index is heading towards oversold territories. The next key support has now shifted further down to 48,800 with 50,000 getting repeatedly breached.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty Bank is struggling to surpass the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average around 50,830 levels, while the recent swing support lies at 49,660. A break below that level can take the Nifty Bank further down to 49,000.Nifty 50's August futures added 2.5% or 2.94 lakh shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. They are now trading at a premium of 22 points from 10 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's August futures added 16.9% or 4.75 lakh shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 0.78 from 1.03 earlier.Aarti Industries and Chambal Fertilisers have entered the F&O ban.Hindustan Copper is out of the F&O ban.Aditya Birla Fashion, Aditya Birla Capital, Bandhan Bank, Biocon, Birlasoft, Granules India, India Cements, IndiaMART, LIC Housing, Manappuram Finance PNB, RBL Bank, SAIL and Sun TV continue to remain in the F&O ban list.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,200 and 24,500 have seen Open Interest addition for this Wednesday's expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 23,900 and 24,150 have seen Open Interest addition for this Wednesday's expiry.",

While the dip got bought into, similar to what the trend has been over the last few sessions, the Nifty could not sustain at higher levels as the recovery got sold into.The market remained fairly resilient to any potential concerns arising from the latest report from US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research. Unlike the previous instance, the entire market machinery ensured that the market did not face any knee-jerk reaction leading to loss of investor wealth. Clarifications were put out by SEBI, AMFI, market participants also urged calm and the market went relatively unscathed from the events over the weekend.In fact, the Adani Group stocks, all of which opened lower with losses of up to 7%, recovered from the lows of the day and some even ended the session with gains.Keeping the Adani Group aside, the Nifty could not hold on to the 24,350 mark yet again. The index has been making higher highs on the daily chart for the last four trading sessions, meaning the intraday high of the current day being higher than that of the previous day but is failing to hold on to that 24,350 - 24,400 mark which continues to be a resistance zone.Tuesday's session will see a lot of stock specific moves, particularly HDFC Bank, that may determine the trajectory of the Nifty during the session. India's largest lender will see an increase in weightage in the MSCI Global Standard Index but in two tranches. Nuvama Alternative is anticipating inflows worth $1.8 billion in the first adjustment that will take place on August 30.Tuesday's session will see more PSU earnings reactions like Hindustan Copper, RCF, IRFC, HUDCO, along with other names like Vodafone Idea, Camlin Fine Sciences, Ami Organics, Campus Activewear, DOMS Industries, ITI etc.Three Nifty stocks - Hero MotoCorp, Apollo Hospitals and Hindalco report results on Tuesday, along with broader market names like Emcure Pharma, Dish TV, Dilip Buildcon, IRCTC, Muthoot Finance, Piramal Enterprises, HEG, among others.For Monday's trading session, Foreign Institutions continued to be net sellers in the cash market but were nearly cancelled out by domestic institutions, who were net buyers of nearly the same quantum.The Nifty is in an uncertain zone between levels of 24,500 - 24,700, which represents a bearish cap. Only a close above the 20-Day Exponential Moving Average around 24,500 can take the Nifty towards 24,700. On the downside, 24,200 is a key level for the Nifty and a sustained break below that will indicate the resumption of the recent market sell-off, said Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said that a small positive candle was formed on the daily chart, signaling a high wave type candle pattern, indicating high volatility in the market. He added that only a decisive upmove above 24,400 - 24,500 levels can bring the bulls back into the market. Immediate downside support is at 24,100.Kotak Securities' Shrikant Chouhan believes that the current intraday market texture is non-directional and hence advises level-based trading for day traders. For the bulls, 24,400 is an immediate breakout zone, above which, the index can move towards 24,500 - 24,550. The Nifty can retest levels of 24,200 - 24,170 on the downside if it breaks below 24,300.Since HDFC Bank will be the stock to watch out for on Tuesday, that will keep the Nifty Bank in focus as well. The index recovered over 400 points from the lows of the day to end above the mark of 50,500. It had made an attempt to test 51,000 on the upside as well, but reversed from its current resistance zone above 50,800. Tuesday will also be the weekly expiry for the Nifty Financial Services index.The Nifty Bank is gradually inching higher as evident on the hourly chart and is currently above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level which is around the 50,550 mark. On the downside, support remains at 50,000, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. He wants the index to close above the 51,100 mark and until then, the short-term outlook may remain on the weaker side.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that a sustained move for the Nifty Bank above levels of 50,710 can push the index forward to 51,000 - 51,200 levels. He advises a buy-on-dips strategy for the index. 49,870 on the downside will be a strong short-term support.Nifty 50's August futures shed 4,975 shares in Open Interest on Monday. They are currently trading at a premium of 10 points from 34 points earlier. On the other hand, the Nifty Bank's August futures shed 2.9% or 84,555 shares in Open Interest on Monday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 1.03 from 1.09 earlier.Sun TV has entered the F&O ban.GNFC is out of the F&O ban.Aditya Birla Fashion, Aditya Birla Capital, Bandhan Bank, Biocon, Birlasoft, Granules India, Hindustan Copper, India Cements, IndiaMART, LIC Housing, Manappuram Finance, PNB, RBL Bank and SAIL continue to remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,400 and 25,000 saw Open Interest addition for this Wednesday's weekly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,000 and 24,400 saw Open Interest addition for this Wednesday's weekly expiry.",

With the turn of events over the weekend, the upcoming holiday-shortened week also promises to be nothing less.In another report released over the weekend, US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research has alleged that market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India's (SEBI) reluctance to act against the Adani Group might be linked to its chief Madhabi Puri Buch, having stakes in offshore funds associated with the conglomerate.In response, Buch has labelled the claims has \"baseless\" and characterised them as an attempt at \"character assassination.\"Hindenburg accused Buch and her husband of holding undisclosed investments in obscure offshore funds located in Bermuda and Mauritius\u2014entities reportedly utilized by Vinod Adani, the elder brother of group chairman Gautam Adani, to engage in round-tripping of funds and inflate stock prices.This yet again puts the Adani Group companies in the spotlight for Monday's trading session. Shares of most group companies have already recovered all the losses they made after the first Hindenburg report in January 2023.The Adani Group has also responded by saying that their overseas holding structure is fully transparent and that the Group has no commercial relationship with individuals or matters mentioned in the report.It was a relatively steady end to the week last Friday with the Nifty closing above the 24,350 mark. Although it could not prevent a second-straight weekly loss, it managed to claw back most of that on Friday with a 250-point surge.The handover from Wall Street has been largely positive with the benchmark indices ending Friday's session with moderate gains. But it is highly likely that the focus on Monday for the Indian markets will be the Hindenburg report which may cloud an on-the-mend sentiment for equities instead of global cues, which have been the focal point all through last week.Barring the Adani Group companies, REITs will also be in focus as Hindenburg's new report also claims that SEBI's regulations on REITs benefitted Blackstone, which is the sponsor of three out of the four Indian listed REITS. Blackstone is also where the SEBI Chairperson's husband Dhaval Buch was a senior advisor. The report alleged the SEBI chief promoted REITs as an investment product to benefit Blackstone.PSU stocks will be in focus as well after another company reported disappointing results. Bharat Dynamics joined the list of PSU earnings disappointing the street after RVNL, IRCON and even BHEL. Cochin Shipyard has turned out to be the only outlier so far.Foreign and domestic institutions were both net buyers in the cash market during Friday's trading session.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said that a small candle was formed on the daily chart with a minor upper and lower shadow. A further upmove from here could possibly result in complete filling of the gap around levels of 24,690. But for that, the Nifty will need a decisive move above 24,450. Immediate support is at 24,100.A breakout above 24,450 range can fill the recent gap around 24,700 levels on the Nifty. Support on the downside is at 24,100 - 24,000, said Angel One's Rajesh Bhosale. A break below that can lead to further downsides. He advises any bounce to be used as an opportunity to reduce long positions.Kotak Securities' Amol Athawale said that the larger texture of the market is still weak and as long as the Nifty trades above 24,200, the pullback formation is likely to continue up to 24,525 levels or even 24,625 levels. On the downside, a break below 24,200 can lead to further selling pressure towards levels of 24,000.The Nifty Bank also ended higher on Friday but posted weekly losses in-line with the Nifty. The index has taken a backseat with all the focus being on the Nifty through the week gone by. Despite a two-day surge, the index failed to close above the 50,500 mark and that will be a key level to watch on the upside on Monday.The Nifty Bank hangs near the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement levels, which are placed around the 50,520 levels but remains below its 20 and 50-Day Moving Average. The Nifty Bank can head higher if it manages to break above the 50,800 levels but a decline below 50,000 could weaken the short-term outlook, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty Bank has formed a hammer pattern on the weekly charts, indicating strength. If the index sustains above 50,710 levels, it can trigger a fresh rally towards 51,000 - 51,200 levels. He advises a buy-on-dips strategy on the Nifty Bank. On the downside 49,650 will be a firm support.Nifty 50's August futures shed 5.1% or 6.34 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday. They are now trading at a premium of 34 points from 19.55 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's August futures shed 4.9% or 1.5 lakh shares in Open Interest. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.09 from 1.04 earlier.Bandhan Bank, Biocon, Granules India and SAIL have entered the F&O ban.Aditya Birla Fashion, Aditya Birla Capital, India Cements, Birlasoft, GNFC, IndiaMART, RBL Bank, Hindustan Copper, LIC Housing, Manappuram Finance and PNB continue to remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,400 and 25,000 have seen Open Interest addition for this Wednesday's weekly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,000 and 24,400 have seen Open Interest addition for this week's expiry.",

Turns out that the answer veers more towards the latter but Thursday's session was more topsy-turvy and volatile than a full fledged sell-off.The Nifty yet again struggled at the 24,350 mark, reversing from those levels after a hawkish RBI policy, where Governor Shaktikanta Das left rates and stance unchanged but cautioned on food inflation. Other than the policy commentary, the Nifty weekly expiry also added to the volatility in the markets on Thursday. At one point, the India VIX was up over 6% in the session, but cooled off towards the later part of the session.Despite the volatility, the Nifty managed to respect levels at both ends. It struggled to cross 24,350 on the upside but respected the 24,100 level on the downside, closing above it. For Friday, that becomes the broad range for the index.IT was one index that saw selling pressure and was the biggest contributor to the Nifty downside on Thursday. Shares like LTIMindtree fell over 4% on more reports suggesting that the stock will be excluded from the Nifty 50 during its next rejig in September, just a year after being included. Infosys too was one of the biggest point contributors to the Nifty downside.The other important question we asked was whether PSUs, beaten down over the last few sessions would see selling pressure if the market turned wobbly and they did, particularly those that disappointed on the earnings front. RVNL fell 5% after its quarterly EBITDA nearly halved from last year, taking with it other railway stocks too.The US weekly jobless claims fell to 2,33,000, which was below expectations in a positive sign for the labor market. The US stocks have responded in kind with the S&P 500 posting its best day since November 2022 , the Dow Jones gaining nearly 700 points and the Nasdaq advancing by 2.8%. Wall Street had a forgettable session on Wednesday and that too played a part in keeping sentiments subdued here in India.The Nifty has now declined in four out of the last five trading sessions and is down 2.5% for the week. As of Thursday's close, this is currently the worst week for the Nifty in 2024.For Friday's session, stocks like Eicher Motors, Biocon, LIC, IRCON, ABB India, SAIL, Sobha, VA Tech Wabag among other names will react to their quarterly results reported after market hours on Thursday.Grasim, Trent, Balkrishna Industries, Berger Paints, Bharat Dynamics, Concord Biotech, Honasa Consumers, Info Edge among other stocks will be reporting their results on Friday.Foreign Institutions continued to remain net sellers in the cash market on Thursday, while domestic investors were buyers albeit in a smaller quantity.The short-term trend of the Nifty remains choppy, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities due to lack of follow-through buying and a strong overhead resistance. He expects some more weakness or consolidation in the short-term, adding that a fall below 23,900 can trigger another round of correction. Only a decisive move above 24,350 will bring the bulls back into action.Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities observed the formation of a double-top formation on the Nifty's daily chart, indicating further weakness from the current levels. He sees 24,100 as an important level for the Nifty, below which 24,000 - 23,925 on the Nifty is also possibly, while on the upside, 24,350 is an immediate hurdle.While the Nifty showed weakness, the Nifty Bank ended in the positive on Thursday, courtesy of some resilience by an underperforming HDFC Bank. Despite this resilience on Thursday, the Nifty Bank is down 2.4% for the week and is also poised to report its worst week since May this year. The index is also down for the fourth week in the last five weeks.The Nifty Bank continues to trade in a range between the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of 50,600 on the upside and the 50% retracement of 49,700 levels on the downside and only a breakout in either direction will provide a clear side for the index, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. A move above 50,350 will take the index back towards 50,600 - 50,750 zones.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty Bank has formed a small green candle on the daily chart and for a fresh bullish trigger, it will have to sustain above 50,690 levels. On the downside, 49,650 is an important support.Nifty 50's August futures shed 3.1% or 3.9 lakh shares in Open Interest on Thursday. They are now trading at a premium of 19.95 points from 68.95 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's August futures shed 0.4% or 12,195 shares in Open Interest on Thursday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.04 from 0.88 earlier.PNB has entered the F&O Ban.Aditya Birla Fashion, Aditya Birla Capital, India Cements, Birlasoft, GNFC, IndiaMART, RBL Bank, Hindustan Copper, LIC Housing Finance and Manappuram Finance continue to remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,200 to 25,000 have seen Open Interest addition for next week's weekly expiry. Since next Thursday will be a market holiday, the weekly expiry will take place a day earlier, on Wednesday.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes of 23,000, 23,500, 22,500 and 24,200 saw Open Interest addition for next Wednesday's expiry.",

These comments spurred a recovery across the Asia-Pacific indices, which had initially opened lower, and consequently aided sentiment on Dalal Street as well.Wednesday was also the day that marked a comeback of the beaten down stocks. PSUs like IREDA and HAL, which were on a six-day losing streak, having corrected anywhere between 20% and 25% from their respective peaks, saw a rebound of over 5% each. Metals, Auto, which were some of the top underperformers over the last three sessions, also made a comeback.However, Chris Wood of Jefferies would like to see the Indian markets correct a little more before he puts money to work. He told CNBC Asia in an exclusive interview that if he had the mandate to invest $100 in India right now, he would only invest a third of that and hold the rest as cash. You can read more on that here. Wednesday's move can be seen both ways. The glass half full would want to believe that Monday's low of 23,890 becomes the immediate swing low and that the Nifty will continue to recover further ground for the rest of the week. On the flip side, the one seeing the glass as half empty would call Wednesday's move a 'bull trap' ahead of two key events on Thursday - one being the RBI's policy decision and the other being the weekly options expiry of the Nifty.The index has two important levels to conquer on the upside. It closed on Wednesday just a shade below 24,300. Therefore, Monday's high of 24,350 and Tuesday's high of 24,382 become important levels for the Nifty to cross before aiming to scale higher. Wall Street did open positive but in a sharp reversal from the highs of the session, the indices ended in the red.Thursday's session will see stocks like Apollo Tyres, Godrej Consumer, Welspun Corp, Balaji Amines, Sula Vineyards, among others react to their results reported after market hours on Wednesday.Alembic Pharma, CONCOR, Cochin Shipyard, Garden Reach Shipbuilders, LIC, Page Industries, JB Chemicals, RVNL, IRCON International, MRF, among other broader market stocks and PSUs report results on Thursday.Foreign institutions continue to remain net sellers in the cash market on Wednesday, while domestic institutions remained net buyers.Immediate resistance for the Nifty is at 24,350 and the RSI oscillators on the lower timeframe charts also hinted at a pullback move, but it is too early to take a call on whether the correction is over, said Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com. Post 24,350, the next hurdle stands at 24,500. On the flip side, 24,000 - 23,900 is the immediate support.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said that a follow through upmove is needed to consider this as a short-term bottom reversal pattern. Only a decisive move above 24,400 can take the index to levels of 24,700. Immediate support is at 24,050.LKP Securities' Rupak De is of the view that an indecisive candlestick pattern remains on the daily chart with resistance on the upside between 24,400 and 24,500 levels. Selling pressure around that level may induce a correction but a move above 24,500 will change the trend to bullish.The last hour move on the Nifty was led by a recovery in the Nifty Bank, the underperformer, which saw its weekly expiry play out towards the close of the trading session. The Nifty Bank not only recovered over 350 points from the lows of the day, but also managed to reclaim the mark of 50,000 on the upside by the close of trade. Levels around 49,700 become important on the downside, ahead of the RBI policy decision on Thursday.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities said that the hourly chart of the Nifty Bank continues to show lower lows, indicating a mild bearish trend. The 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level around 50,600 is a key hurdle and the index must overcome that to trigger a bigger upside.The Nifty Bank has formed a homing pigeon candlestick pattern, which is a bullish reversal pattern, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. If the index manages to hold Tuesday's high of 50,690 on the upside, it can see fresh momentum. On the downside, 49,650 is an important support.Nifty 50's August futures shed 5.3% or 7.07 lakh shares in Open Interest. They are now trading at a premium of 68.95 points from 64.35 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's August futures shed 0.2% or 5,640 shares in Open Interest. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 0.88 from 0.71 earlier.Aditya Birla Fashion has entered the F&O ban.Chambal Fertilisers and Granules India have exited the F&O ban.Aditya Birla Capital, India Cements, Birlasoft, GNFC, IndiaMART, RBL Bank, Hindustan Copper, LIC Housing and Manappuram Finance remain in the F&O ban.For today's weekly expiry, the Nifty 50 Call Strikes of 24,400 and 24,600 have seen Open Interest addition, while those of 24,000 and 24,200 have seen shedding in Open Interest.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,000 and 24,300 have seen Open Interest addition for today's expiry.",

Even after staying in the green for most parts of the trading session on Tuesday, the Nifty could not hold on to the highs, eventually ending in the negative in a session that was supposed to be one of a relief rally after Monday's brutal selling.It is not as if the global markets were any bad on Tuesday. The Japanese indices staged a recovery from Monday's sell-off and even the US futures remained in the positive through the day. But geopolitical uncertainties, particularly with the situation developing in Bangladesh, along with the one in West Asia, and still no clarity on what the US Federal Reserve would eventually do, ensured that the intraday bounce got sold into.The bigger worry though, comes from the broader markets. The Nifty may have not managed to close above the 24,000 mark, but still managed to hold on to Monday's low and staged a marginal bounce from those levels. The same could not be said for either the Nifty Midcap or the Smallcap index. The Midcap index fell nearly 1,500 points from the highs of the day, it made a lower low on the charts and closed just 100 points above Monday's low.Same is the case for the Smallcap index, which made a low similar to Monday's and closed just 40 points above those levels, after a 500-point drop from the session's highs. The Nifty Financial Services' weekly expiry too was at play in the second half of the session.The US markets have opened in the positive, but the question remains, as to whether they too would be able to hold on to this rebound. The bulls needed a positive handover from Wall Street, they've got one. What remains to be seen is whether that rubs off on our own markets and if it does, will it sustain. The prevailing theme appears to be that of caution, at least till the Reserve Bank of India's policy decision on Thursday.Gujarat Gas, Tata Power, Lupin, PI Industries, Cummins India, VIP Industries, JM Financial, PB Fintech, Gland Pharma are some earnings reactions that will take place during Wednesday's trading session.Apollo Tyres, Godfrey Phillips, GCPL, Gokaldas Exports, Lemon Tree Hotels, Dr. Lal Pathlabs, Pidilite Industries, Radico Khaitan, Talbros Automotive are some companies reporting earnings on Wednesday.After selling over a billion dollars on Monday, foreign institutions continued to remain net sellers in the cash market, while domestic institutions continued to cancel them out with net buying.Technically, there are no signs of the Nifty forming a strong support base, said Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com. He said that the Nifty needs to surpass 24,300 - 24,350 on the upside for any strong pullback, else the Nifty may continue to see a downward move towards 23,630, which is a 38.2% retracement of the upmove from the June 4 lows.Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One said that the Nifty has immediate support between 23,900 - 23,850 levels, a slip below which can take the index further down to 23,600 - 23,550 levels. He advises using any bounce like Tuesday's as a selling opportunity. 24,250, followed by 24,350 - 24,400 are immediate hurdles for the index.Kotak Securities' Shrikant Chouhan said that the immediate support for the Nifty is at 23,900 and a fall below that can take the index down to 23,700 - 23,600 levels, where it has support from retracements and long-term averages. He advises selective buying in case the index falls to those levels. 24,150 and 24,400 are hurdles for the Nifty.Similar to the Nifty Midcap and the Nifty Smallcap index, the Nifty Bank too made a low below Monday's and closed just a few points above those levels. Unlike Monday, it could not hold on to the 50,000 mark either, seeing a 1,000-point drop from the highs of the session. The last three sessions has seen the index shed over 1,800 points. Wednesday will also be the weekly options expiry of the Nifty Bank, which will continue to keep the index in the spotlight.The Nifty Bank has formed a bearish candle with a large body and is hovering around the 50% Fibonacci retracement level around 49,700 and a slip below that can push the index further down to 49,200 - 49,100 levels, said OM Mehra of SAMCO Securities. To regain the upward momentum, the Nifty Bank needs to close above the 50,450 mark.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty Bank tried crossing the previous breakdown point on Tuesday but failed to sustain above it. Therefore, 50,400 - 50,600 will be a major resistance for the index, while 49,500 - 49,000 will be a short-term support.Nifty 50's August futures shed 8.3% or 12.2 lakh shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. They are now trading at a premium of 64.35 points from 47.35 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's August futures added 3.3% or 97,965 shares in Open Interest on Wednesday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio at 0.71 from 0.72 earlier.LIC Housing Finance and Manappuram Finance have entered the F&O ban today.Aditya Birla Capital, Chambal Fertilisers, Granules India, India Cements, Birlasoft, GNFC, IndiaMART, RBL Bank and Hindustan Copper remain in the F&O ban.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes of 23,500 and 23,700 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry, while the 22,550 strike has seen Open Interest shedding.",

Of course, the fall was not as ferocious as that day, but was a sell-off nonetheless. The Nifty closed below its budget-day low of 24,074, even slipped below 24,000 at one point but somehow salvaged that level on close, with 46 index stocks ending the day with losses.No sectoral index was spared. Metal, Media, Real Estate, PSU Banks, Auto, all of them fell at least 4% or more on Monday. The India VIX, saw its biggest single-day surge since August 2015. At the highest point of the day, the index had rallied over 50%. Only a handful of FMCG and Pharma names bucked the trend in a session that had only one stock advancing for ever 12 that declined.Tuesday morning's action on the Sensex and Nifty would depend on how the US markets fare overnight. At the end of Monday's trading session on Wall Street, the Dow Jones fell over 1,000 points, while the S&P 500 fell over 3%, registering their worst day since September 2022. The Nasdaq Composite too fell over 3.5%. Post the close of trade, the futures are seeing some bit of a bounce with the Nasdaq futures trading with gains of over 200 points, while the Dow Futures are also trading with a similar quantum.For Tuesday's trading session, stocks like Bharti Airtel, ONGC, Bharti Hexacom, Deepak Nitrite, BEML, HCC Brigade Enterprises, BLS International among others will react to their quarterly results, which were reported after market hours on Monday.Cummins India, Gujarat Gas, Gland Pharma, Tata Power, PI Industries, Lupin, TVS Motor, JM Financial, IIFL Finance are some stocks reporting earnings on Tuesday.On Monday, Foreign Institutions were net sellers worth over \u20b910,000 crore in the cash market, while domestic institutions were net buyers by a similar quantum.\"It's time to step in. Today is an oversold market. We use this proprietary indicator known as the \u2018momentum swing\u2019, which is there on our strike platform, and it's reading it 2% right now, what that means is that 98% of stocks are showing negative momentum. So when we see 98% of stocks showing negative momentum, that's the day to consider buying,\" said Rohit Srivastava of Indiacharts.com.Dipan Mehta of Elixir Equities though, shared contrasting views, saying that he is waiting for a very important level of 22,500 on the Nifty, which would imply a 10% correction from current levels, before he starts buying the stocks on his list.\"Buying the dip has always worked in the past. We have seen from June 22 or from March 23, markets haven't seen a very big correction. And every dips have been taken advantage of. So this time around, it would be wiser to hold back a little before jumping in the buy on dips kind of a strategy,\" Deepak Jasani of HDFC Securities said.Dinshaw Irani of Helios Mutual Fund believes that valuations are not the only reason why the markets corrected on Monday. It needed a trigger and that came about in the form of the Yen Carry Trade.\"I'm not calling out a bear market at all. My feeling is it's a correction in a bull market, but the fact is that these corrections can be very savage. Our feel is that this year itself, this particular calendar year itself is going to be very volatile and choppy because there are going to be crosswinds all across the globe going forward. So one has to be very careful and that's why you'll see that our portfolios are more or less large-cap heavy as such and we are fairly conservative towards the mid-caps,\" Irani said.\"Historically, periods of volatility have provided opportunities for investors to realign their asset allocation. If the valuations become more reasonable, this current period of market turbulence can be used strategically to consider raising exposure to equities gradually with 5-7 years view. Despite the current uncertainties, the long-term outlook remains constructive due to strong fundamentals, government initiatives, and a stable banking sector,\" according to Vinit Sambre of DSP Mutual Fund.Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com remains cautious on the market and the short-term trend for the Nifty remains negative. He advises avoiding bottom fishing and if the Nifty breaks Monday's low of 23,893, it may lead to a correction towards levels of 23,630.Angel One's Rajesh Bhosale said that 24,250 is an immediate resistance for the Nifty and traders should avoid bottom fishing. 23,900, followed by 23,600 on the downside are important support levels with a major support between 23,400 - 23,300 levels, which is the 50% retracement of the post-election result-day upmove.\"Technically, after a long time Nifty closed below 20 day SMA (Simple Moving Average) which is largely negative. It also formed long bearish candle on daily charts, which supports further weakness from the current levels,\" Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities said. He highlights 24,000 as a key level, above which, a pullback towards 24,250 is possible, but further downside can take the index down to 23,800.Just as the Nifty somehow managed to hold on to the 24,000 mark on closing, the Nifty Bank too managed to hold on to the 50,000 mark before the close of trade. The index found some support at levels of 49,700 before staging a brief recovery from the lows of the session. Yet, it was a 1,250-point cut for the day and that 50,000 and 49,700 levels become key for the downside for Tuesday's session, which also happens to be the weekly expiry for the Nifty Financial Services index.Nifty 50's August futures shed 3.6% or 5.5 lakh shares in Open Interest on Monday. They are now trading at a premium of 47.35 points from a discount of 6.15 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's August futures added 13.5% or 3.5 lakh shares in Open Interest on Monday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 0.72 from 0.91 earlier.Hindustan Copper has entered the F&O ban today.Aditya Birla Capital, Chambal Fertilisers, Granules India, India Cements, Birlasoft, GNFC, Indiamart and RBL Bank remain in the F&O ban list.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,200 to 24,500 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.While the 23,000 Put strike saw Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry, the 24,100, 24,500 and 24,700 strikes saw Open Interest shedding.",

Weak global cues coupled with geopolitical uncertainties took every global market down and along with it, the Nifty as well.In any other phase during the recent past, a gap down would result in the dip getting bought into at some point during the day. That did not happen on Friday. The dip came, but there was no buying at lower levels. Even the slightest recovery was swiftly sold into. From just above 25,000, the Nifty is now within touching distance of breaking below the 24,700 mark on the downside.With the way the US markets sold off on Friday and with tensions rising in West Asia, that looks like a mere formality on Monday morning. US markets fell after the non-farm payrolls data and over fears that the Fed has been too late in starting to cut interest rates as the economy has started to weaken. The Nasdaq has already entered correction territory (10% fall from record high). The Japanese markets too had their worst day since 1987 on Friday.The Nifty also snapped an eight-week gaining streak after Friday's fall. Autos, Metals and IT led the losses on Friday, with Pharma emerging as the outperformer. Even the broader markets fell in-line with the benchmark indices. The fall resulted in the India Volatility Index seeing a sharp spike on Friday, with the 10% surge taking it to levels near 15.Monday's session will see earnings reaction from Nifty components like SBI, Divi's Laboratories, Titan, Britannia, who reported results after market closing on Friday, along with broader market names like Amara Raja, Bank of India, JK Tyre, Nucleus Software, Savita Oil and others.Bharti Airtel, ONGC, Bharti Hexacom, Honeywell Automation, Devyani International, Deepak Nitrite, Marico, among others will be reporting their results on Monday.Foreign institutions were net sellers in the cash market on Friday, while domestic institutions were net buyers.On an immediate basis, the Nifty is finding support between 24,600 - 24,500, while on the other hand, till the index closes above 25,100, it may see rangebound movement. However, a close below 24,500 will take the Nifty down to 24,250 or even 24,100 and a bounce towards 24,900 will be an opportunity to reduce long positions.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities believes that the market action is indicating a short-term top reversal pattern for the Nifty at the new highs of 25,078. He expects some more weakness towards 24,600 - 24,500 levels before any potential upside bounce. Immediate resistance is at 24,900.Angel One's Osho Krishnan said that the Nifty has a strong support between 24,600 - 24,500 levels and till the index remains above those levels there should not be any cause of concern for the market. On the other hand, the bearish gap on the daily chart between 24,850 - 24,950 will be an immediate resistance.In comparison to the Nifty, the Nifty Bank fell lesser in quantum and even managed to end higher for the week. The other important aspect is that the index managed to hold on to the mark of 51,000 which has been a key support for the index. It remains to be seen whether these levels are sustained in case of a gap down opening on Monday morning.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta maintains that the Nifty Bank is consolidating between 51,000 - 52,300 and the traders are advised to wait for a breakout on either side of the range before taking further action on the Nifty Bank.Kotak Securities' Athawale said that the Nifty Bank remained above levels of 51,000, which is a positive and can help take the index back to 52,000. However, a close below 51,000 may lead to further weakness towards levels of 50,500 or even 50,200 on the downside.Nifty 50's August futures shed 2.9% or 4.5 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday. They are now trading at a discount of 6.15 points from a premium of 21.35 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's August futures added 4.6% or 1.2 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 0.91 from 1.29 earlier.Aditya Birla Capital and Chambal Fertilisers have entered the F&O Ban.Granules India, India Cements, Birlasoft, GNFC, IndiaMART and RBL Bank remain in the F&O Ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,800 and 25,500 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,000 and 24,700 have seen Open Interest addition, while the 25,000 strike has seen Open Interest shedding.",

After three days of teasing the landmark and making every market participant go into the \"Will it? Won't it?\" mode, the Nifty finally scaled the mark of 25,000 on Thursday, thereby starting off the month of August on a positive note.What generally follows an event like this is a sell-off from higher levels. There was some bit of resistance for the Nifty as well around the 25,100 mark owing to which it reversed from its latest record high of 25,078, but the fact that the index managed to hold on to 25,000 at close, will give the bulls a lot of comfort.While the Nifty manage to hold on to its celebratory landmark, the same could not be said for the broader markets. The Midcap index fell 800 points from the highs of the day, while the Smallcap index fell 300 points from the highs. Both the indices ended with losses of close to a percent as profit booking came in from the high flying PSU Banks and Real Estate names. Select PSU shares also came under some selling pressure.For the week, the Nifty is now up just under a percent and is positioning itself for a ninth straight weekly advance, which if materialized, would be the longest weekly winning run since 2010 for the index when it had a similar run between February and April.Friday's session will see stocks like Tata Motors and ITC react to their respective quarterly numbers, along with stocks like Godrej Agrovet, Kalyan Jewellers, Vaibhav Global among others.The final trading day of the week will also see earnings from Dalmia Bharat, Delhivery, CAMS, Hindustan Zinc, UPL, PSP Projects among other such broader market names.Foreign institutions were net buyers in the cash market after a prolonged selling phase after the budget, while domestic institutions chose to book some profits at higher levels.Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities expects this bullish sentiment to continue till the Nifty is trading above the mark of 24,950, taking the index to levels of 25,100 or even 25,200. On the flip side, a slip below 24,950 can lead to a correction in the index towards levels of 24,850 - 24,800.Even as the Nifty has crossed 25,000, the crucial hurdle between 25,000 - 25,100 remains intact, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities, anticipating further consolidation or a minor near-term dip. Immediate support is at 24,750.Angel One's Osho Krishnan says 24,800 now is a key support for the Nifty followed by support zones between 24,600 - 24,500 levels. On the upside, 25,080 - 25,100 is the immediate hurdle, above which, the index can move to levels of 25,340.The Nifty Bank continued with its sluggish moves on Thursday and also continues to face resistance above the mark of 51,800. The index may have gained for the fifth day in a row but continues to remain stuck in a range. For the week, the banking index is up 0.5% and if it does manage to end the week with gains, it will be its first weekly advance in four weeks.Even as the Nifty Bank has remained rangebound through the week, it has maintained a positive bias, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. The upper bollinger band of 52,050 acts as a resistance for the index on the daily timeframe and a breakout above this can push the index higher. Support on the downside is at 51,100.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty Bank continues to consolidate between 51,100 - 52,300 and hence 52,000 - 52,300 will serve as a resistance, while 51,100 remains a strong support.",

But the kind of market that we have seen over the last few months, even three days of waiting for a landmark and that not materialising becomes a test of patience.50 points now separate the Nifty and 25,000, 49 to be precise. That still seems a long way away considering the index came within 0.2 points of that on Monday, 30 points on Tuesday and 16 points on Wednesday but could not cross that landmark. 24,984 was the high made by the Nifty on Wednesday and that now becomes the first hurdle to cross on Thursday for the Nifty.The US Federal Reserve has possibly given what the street was looking for. It kept interest rates unchanged last night but Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that a rate cut in September is \"on the table\" provided that data continues to be as encouraging as it currently is. Powell did cite progress in bringing inflation down to the Fed's 2% target. The Fed Chair had earlier mentioned that the central bank will not wait for inflation to fall to 2% before it starts cutting rates.Wall Street cheered the Fed commentary with the S&P 500 marking its best day since February this year, while the Nasdaq ending with gains of over 2%.Nifty ended the month of July with gains of 3.9%, following up a 6.6% advance in June. Barring May, when the index ended 0.3% lower and January, when the monthly returns were just a few points in the negative, the Nifty has gained in every single month of the calendar year 2024 so far.August generally has been a positive month for the Nifty as it has delivered positive returns in three out of the last four years. Last year saw the index fall 2.5%, but gained 3.5% in 2022, 8.7% in 2021 and 2.8% in 2020. The first day of the new month will also be the weekly options expiry of the Nifty 50 contracts.Coal India, Tata Steel, Bank of Baroda, Prestige Estates, Phoenix Mills, Relaxo Footwear are some of the earnings reactions in Thursday's trading session.Thursday's session will also see the Adani Nifty twins - Enterprises and Ports report results, along with Sun Pharma, ITC, Tata Motors, Dabur, Kalyan Jewellers, Thermax, Tube Investments, HPL Electric and Power and Godrej Agrovet among others.Foreign institutions continued to remain net sellers in the cash market on Wednesday, while domestic institutions were net buyers.Immediate support for the Nifty is around 24,750, followed by 24,600, and only if the index breaks these supports then the index could see some correction, else the uptrend would continue, said Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com. A break above 25,000 can lead to an upmove towards 25,330.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said that the positive chart patterns of higher tops and higher bottoms are intact on the charts and the Nifty is currently on the way to form another higher top of the pattern. While immediate supports are at 24,750 levels, a decisive move above 25,100 can open sharp upside for the index.Kotak Securities' Shrikant Chouhan is of the view that the current market texture is non-directional and a break above 24,980 can take the index till 25,125 levels on the upside. He expects the sentiment to change if the Nifty slips below 24,800, which can lead to retesting of 24,675 levels on the downside.The Nifty Bank continued to remain sluggish on its weekly options expiry, trading in a narrow 300-point range. The final few minutes saw the index recover from the lows and end in the positive territory and above the mark of 51,500. It remains to be seen whether it can sustain those levels in opening trade on Thursday.The Nifty Bank has stayed below the 21-Day Exponential Moving Average, while the daily RSI has entered a bullish crossover, says Rupak De of LKP Securities. A sustained move above 51,600 can trigger a rally towards 52,000 - 52,200, while support on the downside is at 51,200 - 51,000.Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said that the outlook for the Nifty Bank remains bearish with resistance at the 52,000 level and is trading below its 10 and 20-Day Exponential Moving Average. He advises investors to adopt a sell-on-rise strategy. The index has last support at 51,200, below which the index can fall towards 50,800.Nifty 50's August futures added 5.5% and 7.99 lakh shares in Open Interest on Wednesday.

The Nifty opens higher, scales higher, makes a high, ignites hopes of scaling 25,000 yet again and then comes a sell-off in the final few minutes of the session, taking the Nifty back to the exact same levels at which it started the session at.The weekly expiry of the Nifty Financial Services index had a big role to play in the reversal that the Nifty witnessed on Tuesday. The index reversed nearly 250 points from the highs of the session, which took the Nifty Bank lower and consequently, the Nifty as well. If one puts the three charts next to each other, they would look a splitting image of each other.24,971 was the high that the Nifty made on Tuesday and that will become the first barrier for the index to cross as it steps into the mid-week trade. For the index that has had a trading range of 550 points in the last two trading sessions, the eventual gain at close, is only three points! Wednesday will also be the weekly expiry of the Nifty Bank, which will yet again bring the indices back in the spotlight.It will also be the last trading day of the month on Wednesday and as volatile a month as this has been, the index has so far gained 3.5% since the start of July.Wednesday also promises to be an earnings-reaction and earnings-heavy day. Stocks like Tata Consumer Products, Ajanta Pharma, Dixon Technologies, Indus Towers, Navin Fluorine, Torrent Power, Macrotech Developers among others will be reacting to their quarterly results.Four Nifty 50 constituents - Coal India, Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki and Tata Steel report results on Wednesday along with broader market names like Adani Power, Ambuja Cements, Aster DM Healthcare, Bank of Baroda, BHEL, Deepak Fertilisers, Birlasoft, Godrej Properties, Mankind Pharma, Prestige Estates and Zee Entertainment.Foreign institutions remained net sellers in the cash market on Tuesday, while domestic institutions continued to be net buyers.The short-term Nifty trend is choppy but the near-term trend remains intact, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities, adding that the overall chart pattern is indicating some more consolidation or a minor dip in the next 1-2 sessions before a bounce from the lows. Immediate support remains at 24,600, while a move above 25,100 will bring the bulls back into action.Osho Krishnan of Angel One believes that 25,000 will be a challenge for the bulls and only a sustained move above that level will begin the next leg of the rally. Immediate support stays at 24,600. He added that the muted price action does not change the scenario but raises concerns regarding the inherent strength of the index.An underperforming Nifty Bank will again be in focus on Wednesday as it is the weekly options expiry. The index kept the Nifty gains in check through most of the July month, led the resurgence on Friday and Monday, and the sell-off from higher levels also took the Nifty down with it. The Nifty Bank made a high of 51,957 on Tuesday but corrected over 500 points from those levels, a script similar to Monday's drop.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities said that the Nifty Bank formed a shooting star pattern on its charts for the second day in a row and remained below its 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of 51,650. The immediate support remains at 51,000, followed by 50,750, with resistance at 52,100. The RSI too is struggling to cross the mark of 50.The Nifty Bank is encountering resistance from a falling trend line which is near levels of 52,300 and hence, 52,000 - 52,300 will continue to act as a barrier for the index, while 51,000 will remain a strong support, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates.Nifty 50's August futures added 1.9% or 2.75 lakh shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. They are now trading at a premium of 71.8 points from 74.35 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's August futures shed 13.4% or 1.31 lakh shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.23 from 1.14 earlier.India Cements remains the only stock in the F&O ban.For this Thursday's weekly expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes of 24,900 and 25,100 saw Open Interest addition.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,800 and 24,900 have seen Open interest addition.",

But none could have been as close as a 0.2 point difference that separated the Nifty and 25,000 on Monday. The Nifty made another record high, but instead of scaling the 25,000 mark, the index reversed from levels of 24,999.8.And Monday's reversal was no ordinary reversal, a proper 170-point drop from the highs of the day, which is nearly what the Nifty needed to scale 25,000 on Monday. After giving up all the gains, the index ended at almost the same level as it did on Friday.Despite strong contributions from Reliance Industries and L&T after another order win, the index could not sustain at higher levels due to a sell-off in banking stocks, which were the big contributors to the upmove on Friday and the initial surge on Monday as well.But what led to this collapse on Monday? Almost every index heavyweight contributed to the correction from higher levels. ICICI Bank, which was once the top contributor to the Nifty upside, corrected nearly 2.5% from the highs of the day and end with gains of just 0.5%. Most of the other index heavyweights too, from HDFC Bank, Axis Bank to ITC and even TCS and Infosys corrected anywhere between 1% and 2% from their respective highs, dragging the Nifty lower in the process.The banks will again be in focus on Tuesday because it will be the weekly expiry of the Financial Services index, which in turn will also put the spotlight on the Nifty Bank. The resultant volatility on Monday also sent the India VIX higher by 5%.Tuesday's session will see stocks like ACC, HPCL, Colgate-Palmolive, Data Patterns, KEI Industries, Quess Corp, Kalpataru Projects, Pfizer and others react to their quarterly results.Tata Consumer Products, Ajanta Pharma, Dixon Technologies, Indus Towers, Macrotech, Sapphire foods, Titagarh Rail, Torrent Power, MOIL, Navin Fluorine, and others will be reporting their June quarter results tomorrow. Indus Towers will also be in focus because the board will consider its first share buyback in eight years.Foreign institutions were net sellers in the cash market on Monday, while domestic institutions were net buyers.Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com said that there could be some slow and gradual moves on the Nifty or a pullback towards support levels within the uptrend. Immediate supports are 24,620 and 24,500, while resistance as per the retracement of the recent correction comes up to 25,065 and 25,340.Angel One's Osho Krishnan believes that 24,600 is an immediate support for the Nifty, followed by the 24,500 zone. A breakout above the 25,000 level will take the Nifty to its 161.8% retracement of the previous week's swing, which comes up to levels of 25,340 on the upside.The near-term uptrend of the Nifty remains intact, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities, who also anticipates some choppy moves or a minor dip in the next one to two sessions before the uptrend resumes. 24,600 is an immediate downside support with upside barriers between 25,000 - 25,100.The Nifty Bank may have ended higher today but not before correcting nearly 900 points from the highs of the day, which were above the mark of 52,000. The index was back above 52,000 for the first time after July 23, the day of the Union Budget. With heavyweight banks having sold off from their highs, the effect was bound to show on the Nifty Bank and so it did. Support though, came from PSU banks like PNB, which surged after a strong quarterly performance.The Nifty Bank formed a shooting star pattern on the daily charts indicating short-term weakness despite the surge seen intraday on Monday, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. The index remains below its 20-DMA with support near its 50-DMA at 50,800. A drop below this level could weaken the short-term bullish trend.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the index has found resistance near a short-term trendline near the 52,300 mark, making 52,000 - 52,300 a resistance zone for the Nifty Bank, while 51,000 on the downside will be a strong support.Nifty 50's August futures added 0.5% or 64,600 shares in Open Interest on Monday. They are now trading at a premium of 74.35 points from 187.8 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's August futures shed 1.1% or 21,030 shares in Open Interest on Monday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.14 from 1.36 earlier.India Cements has entered the F&O ban today.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,950 and 25,200 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.On the Put side too, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,900 and 25,000 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's expiry.",

Well, if the price action from Friday is anything to go by, the answer is a loud and resounding \"YES!\"Almost every index heavyweight, be it Reliance Industries, Infosys, TCS, ITC put their hand up on Friday to take the Nifty to a new record high of 24,861. The index began the August F&O series with a 400-point surge, something it gained through an entire series in July. And unlike previous instances, the index has also managed to end close to the day's high, which will give the bulls some comfort.While IT and Reliance have been contributors through and through, what further aided Friday's move was a recovery in banks. The Nifty Bank index recovered nearly 900 points from the lows of the day and barring HDFC Bank, most of the index constituents contributed to the rally on the upside. Infosys, trading at the highest level in two years, is also nearing a record high.August has historically been a good series for the Nifty as barring a 400-point drop last year, the index gained nearly 600 points in 2022 and an even better 850 points in 2021. With Friday's move, the index is now within 165 points of scaling the 25,000 mark. In case that does happen on Monday, it would have taken the index 21 sessions from June 27, which is when it had crossed the mark of 24,000, to scale another 1,000 points.A slew of earnings reactions will be seen during Monday's trading session. Stocks like IndusInd Bank, Bandhan bank, Power Grid, KEC International, Kaynes Tech among others will react to results reported after market hours on Friday. But the reaction to ICICI Bank, who reported results on Saturday, will be the key in determining whether the Nifty manages to scale the 25,000 mark or not. Besides ICICI Bank, stocks like PNB, Anant Raj, MCX, Spandana Sphoorty, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Genus Power, among others will also react to results.Monday's session will see stocks like ACC, BEL, Adani Total Gas, CSB Bank, Data Patterns, HPCL, Kansai Nerolac, Strides Pharma, Kalpataru projects etc. reporting results.Both foreign and domestic institutions were net buyers in the cash market on Friday. The numbers may also be skewed due to the block deal that took place in Sobha on Friday morning.Amol Athawale expects 25,000 to be a key hurdle for the bulls but crossing that can take the Nifty to 25,150 levels. 24,675 - 24,600 on the downside now becomes an important support, below which, the sentiment could change.Angel One's Rajesh Bhosale says that momentum indicators are still in overbought territory and advises avoiding complacency. He sees support on the downside at 24,600, while 25,000 on the downside will be the first barrier. In case, the Nifty does cross 25,000, it can lead to upside levels of 25,340.The short term trend of the Nifty turns positive with the next upside level seen between 25,000 - 25,100, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. Immediate support on the downside is at 24,650.As we highlighted earlier, the recovery in the Nifty Bank also contributed to the Nifty hitting a record high on Friday. ICICI Bank's will be a key reaction to monitor and that will be the key determinant of how the Nifty Bank moves on Monday. The index also closed back above the 51,200 mark and will have its sights on scaling the 51,500 mark on Monday, which has been a key resistance in recent times.The Nifty Bank has formed a bullish belt hold pattern on the daily charts and closed above 51,100 on a weekly basis, signalling strength, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. In the short-term, 51,800 - 52,000 will be the key resistance levels for the index.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities said that the Nifty Bank rebounded from lower levels, maintaining its position above the mark of 50,000 and above the 50-Day Moving Average. Support on the downside remains at 50,900 and any correction towards 51,000 could be a buying opportunity for the 51,800 - 51,900 target on the upside.Nifty 50's August futures added 9.5% or 12.42 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday. They are now trading at a premium of 187.8 points from 49.3 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's August futures added 4.9% or 90,420 shares in Open Interest on Friday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 1.36 from 1.21 earlier. No stocks are currently in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,800 and 25,000 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,500 and 24,800 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.",

But just as it has been the trend through the week, the gap down was consistently bought into and despite five straight days of losses, the Nifty has moved nowhere from where it was at the end of last week.What might give the bulls some comfort is the fact that the Nifty ended nearly at the highest point of the day. The index recovered 200 points from the intraday low of 24,210, indicating that it continues to respect levels in the range it has been trading in. 24,200 - 24,000 on the downside, and 24,500 on the upside.The Nifty ended the session nearly unchanged, which means that it ended the July F&O series with gains of just over 400 points. This was the second consecutive positive F&O series for the Nifty, after the 1,556 points it surged in the month of June.While the dips are getting bought into, the question is whether the Nifty bulls have enough strength to take the index back to levels of 24,800 where it was a few days prior. 24,500, which was earlier a support for the index, has now become the first barrier to cross. That 24,530 level is also what the Nifty will have to close above on Friday to ensure that its seven-week winning run, continues into the eighth.Friday's session will see the market react to results of Tech Mahindra, Ramco Cements, MGL, AU Small Finance Bank, Mphasis, Cyient, Motilal Oswal, VST Industries and others.Cipla, IndusInd Bank, Power Grid, InterGlobe Aviation, Amber Enterprises, Cholamandalam, City Union Bank, Equitas SFB, ESAF SFB, KEC International, Piramal Pharma, SBI Cards, TTK Prestige and others will also be reporting their June quarter results on Friday.Foreign institutions remained net sellers for the third straight session on Thursday, while domestic investors continued to buy.Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One wrote that the Nifty is in a time-wise correction phase with 24,200 - 24,100 acting as a base. In case that is breached on a closing basis, it can trigger a severe price correction. On the upside, 24,500 - 24,600 remains a key resistance zone. He advises traders to have a buy-on-dips and sell-on-rise strategy.The short-term trend of the Nifty remains choppy, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. He expects the lackluster movement with a weak bias to continue for the next one or two sessions before a bounce from the lows. 24,100 - 24,000 are important supports on the downside and this could be a buy-on-dips opportunity, he said. 24,500 is a key hurdle on the upside.The Nifty Bank continues to remain a pressure point for the market, having corrected over 1,400 points over the last three trading sessions. The pressure on Thursday came from Axis Bank and ICICI Bank, with the former reacting to its results. Both the heavyweights together contributed 80 points to the Nifty downside. For the week, the Nifty Bank is down over 2.5% and is poised for its third straight weekly loss.The Nifty Bank closed below the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average as well as the upper band of the wedge, suggesting a weakening trend, indicating a short-term negative sentiment. He advises traders to use any rise in index as an opportunity to sell. The immediate support is between 50,500 - 50,200, while 51,200 - 51,500 is a resistance band.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty Bank failed to close above 51,100, indicating weakness for the index, which is likely to continue till the index remains below that level. On the downside, 50,500 and 50,000 will act as a support.Nifty 50's August futures added 55% or 46.2 lakh shares in Open Interest on Thursday. They are currently trading at a premium of 49.3 points. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's August futures added 52% in Open Interest on Thursday.

The only difference being, the recovery from the lows has not been as convincing as earlier.The correction could've been far worse had the largecap banking stocks not recovered from the lows of the session. Yet, they turned out to be the biggest drags to the index and the primary culprit for the Nifty now having to face resistance at the 24,500 mark, which had been a crucial support zone for a better part of this July series.That July series comes to an end on Thursday for the Nifty 50 contracts. The last three days have turned the series for the index from one of handsome gains, to just another normal series. The last three sessions has seen the Nifty correct over 400 points from its record high of 24,854, thereby also cutting down on the gains it made during the series. For the July series, the Nifty is now up just 400 points, from well over 800 points until July 19.Wednesday's session also saw the Nifty yet again test 24,300 on the downside and recover from those levels. If we discount the budget day dip as a one-off, Wednesday's low for the Nifty at 24,308 was lower than Monday's low of 24,362. The index has now declined for four straight sessions and is slowly grinding lower, indicating the possibility of a price and time-wise correction.Despite the benchmark indices facing selling pressure, the broader markets have been in a league of their own. The Nifty Midcap index gained a percent, the Smallcap index did one better, gaining nearly 2% on Wednesday. Earnings reactions were aplenty as were reactions or continuations to Budget day reactions.Shares of shrimp feed companies like Avanti Feeds, Waterbase, Apex Frozen foods surged up to 20%, while Kaveri Seed built on its Budget-day gains. Thyrocare had a strong day post results, while PSU stocks saw a rebound post a brief sell-off on Tuesday.Thursday's trading session will see stocks like L&T, Axis Bank, SBI Life, JSPL, Sona BLW, IEX, DCB Bank, Karnataka Bank and others react to their quarterly results. Nestle India, Canara Bank, Adani Green Energy, Adani Energy Solutions, Laurus Labs, MGL, Ramco Cements, Ujjivan SFB, VST Industries and others will be reporting their June quarter results on Thursday as well.Foreign investors were net sellers in the cash market on Wednesday as well, while domestic institutions chose to be net buyers.There seems to be more stock specific interest in the market while the Nifty is going through the corrective phase, said Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com, adding that the RSI oscillator on the Nifty is hinting at a continuation of the corrective phase. Immediate downside support is at 24,200, followed by 24,000, while 24,700 - 24,800 remains the resistance zone.Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One expects the Nifty to continue trading in a range on its expiry session. 24,300 - 24,250 zone remains a key support from the index, and a slip below which can push the index back to its budget-day low of 24,074. On the upside, 24,600 remains an immediate hurdle, followed by 24,850.The formation of a bullish hammer pattern and the high wave in two consecutive sessions could signal a temporary halt to the downside momentum, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. Further weakness from here could find support between 24,270 and 24,100, while 24,580 is an immediate hurdle and crossing that could confirm a near-term bottom reversal pattern.The Nifty Bank has been the actual pain point for the Nifty over the last few trading sessions. Since hitting a record high of 53,357 on July 4, the index has corrected over 2,000 points from those levels, led mainly by HDFC Bank. Even on Wednesday, the top three Nifty contributors to the downside were HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and SBI. As we highlighted earlier, had it not been for the 600-point recovery from the lows of the day for the Nifty Bank, the correction on the Nifty could've been much deeper. You can read more about the road ahead for the index here. The Nifty Bank remains below its short-term consolidation breakdown and the sentiment may remain weak as it has closed below its key support level of 51,700 and its 21-Day exponential moving average, said Rupak De of LKP Securities. He advises using a sell-on-rise approach till the index closes above the mark of 52,000. Immediate downside support is now at 50,900, while 51,500 and 52,000 will act as barriers.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty Bank on the daily scale has retested its previous breakout from the rounding bottom pattern and closed above it and also supported its 50-DMA support near 50,950. He added that a short-term relief rally cannot be ruled out till the index sustains 51,000 - 50,950 on the downside. A slip below 50,950 though will trigger fresh weakness for the Nifty Bank.",

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced changes to the STT in the Futures and Options segment, and also made changes to the Short-term and Long-term Capital Gains Tax rates in her Budget speech on Tuesday. Any other day, the market would have had a negative reaction and would have continued to reel with the aftermath of such a move for days.The Nifty did see a dip on Tuesday too post the Budget speech. But in a market driven by domestic liquidity, as swift as the dip was, the recovery was swifter. The index did end in the red, but not before recovering 400 points from the day's low.So where did the recovery come from? FMCG. The FMCG index emerged as the top sectoral gainer with stock specific tailwinds emerging from the Finance Minister's budget address. The top three gainers on the Nifty 50 were FMCG names - ITC, Titan and Tata Consumer Products.ITC received a boost because of no tinkering with tobacco tax, which led to an upgrade from Jefferies. The stock is now within touching distance of hitting the \u20b9500 mark, which will be a record high. Titan and peers like Senco got a boost with a reduction customs duty on Gold, leading to those stocks shining. Adding to that is the increased rural allocation in the budget, which is also likely to spur consumption. Tata Consumer also announced terms of its rights issue which we will read about later in the piece.\"I think it's good that the market has been able to absorb the hike in capital gains tax, and some of the other provisions which have come in. So I think it's a big positive, it just shows that there is liquidity waiting in the wings, any dips are being used to buy into,\" Nilesh Shah of Envision Capital said.The Nifty may have recovered from the lows of the day, but has ended just a fraction below the all important 24,500 mark. That now remains the key level for the index to sustain above as the index digests the Budget commentary, clarifications on various aspects and then take a decision on the road ahead.While the market digests the budget fineprint, it will also react to earnings from Bajaj Finance, Hindustan Unilever, ICICI Prudential, Torrent Pharma, United Spirits, DCM Shriram and other names.Wednesday's session will also see Nifty 50 constituents like Axis Bank, L&T and SBI Life report results, along with other broader market names like Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, Bikaji Foods, Federal Bank, IEX, JSPL, JK Paper, Syngene and Oracle Financial.After multiple days of buying in the cash market, foreign institutions were net sellers in the cash market on Tuesday, while domestic institutions chose to buy the dip.\"If we look at the broader structure post the event, it seems that the index has entered a corrective phase as we had already seen a rally ahead of the budget and the RSI oscillator has given a negative crossover from the overbought zone,\" said Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com. He said that this could be either a time-wise correction along with a price correction and hence there could be a phase of consolidation. Immediate support for the Nifty is at 24,200 and 24,000, while 24,700 - 24,800 is the resistance band.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said that the Nifty's short-term trend remains negative with high volatility. A sustainable move above 24,650 - 24,700 can open the next leg of upside towards 24,850 - 24,900 level in the near-term, while immediate support is at 24,100. \"The emergence of sharp buying and the formation of a positive candle pattern on Tuesday is signalling occurrence of a bullish reversal pattern in the coming session,\" he added.The Nifty Bank was one of the key indices that put pressure on the market post the Budget speech, shedding over 500 points. HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank were the biggest laggards on the Nifty Bank, dragging the index even below the mark of 52,000. The index will also be in focus on Wednesday not just for the results of Axis Bank, but also for the monthly options expiry.The Nifty Bank has formed a lower top, lower bottom pattern indicating weakness, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. 52,000 and 52,500 now become key resistance points for the index, while downside support will now be seen at 51,200 and 51,000.Rupak De of LKP Securities said that the index has slipped below the 21-Day Exponential moving Average, indicating a weakening trend. He expects the sentiment to remain weak in the short-term or until the Nifty Bank stays below 52,100. On the lower end, he expects levels of 51,200 - 51,000 to be tested, while 52,100 - 52,550 will be a resistance band.Nifty 50's futures across series added 16% in Open Interest on Tuesday. Current rollovers are at 82%. The July futures are trading at a discount of 15.95 points from a 0.15 point discount earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's July futures shed 10% or 1.8 lakh shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 0.87 from 1.02 earlier.Chambal Fertilisers, Piramal Enterprises, Bandhan Bank and Hindustan Aeronautics are out of the F&O ban today.For Thursday's monthly expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes between 24,450 and 25,000 have seen Open Interest addition.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 23,900 and 24,450 have seen Open Interest addition. The 23,600 strike has seen shedding in Open Interest.",

Both ended up moving in the opposite direction and hence, the Nifty went nowhere, as both the stocks ended up cancelling each others' moves.Reliance Industries shares fell 3.5% in reaction to its Q1 results and contributed 82 points to the Nifty downside, while shares of HDFC Bank ended 2.2% higher, contributing over 60 points to the Nifty upside. Pressure on the Nifty also came from Kotak Mahindra Bank, ITC, and SBI, which was offset by M&M, Infosys and NTPC.The stock of Monday's session though, was Wipro. After its ADR fell 11.5% on Friday, the Indian entity shares also fell 9% on Monday, marking its biggest single-day drop in 11 years (April 2013). You can read more on that here. All eyes though are now on finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and the Union Budget presentation scheduled for 11 AM on Tuesday. With Nifty having ended almost unchanged, it has managed to defend the 24,500 mark yet again. At one point, the index even fell to levels of 24,350, but the dip was bought into. The market will await cues from the minister as to whether there is any tinkering with the tax slabs or even the Securities Transaction Tax or the Long-term Capital Gains Tax.Budget-specific themes did see movement on the eve of the presentation. Fertiliser stocks like FACT, RCF, Chambal ended with gains between 6% and 10%, while defence PSUs also staged a comeback after 3-4 days of underperformance. Shipbuilders like Mazagon Dock, Cochin Shipyard and Garden Reach also gained up to 5% each.Broader markets also did well on Monday, recovering some of the losses they had in the last few trading sessions. The Midcap index ended over 1% higher, while the Smallcap index ended 0.9% in the green, comfortably outperforming the benchmark indices.Along with the Union Budget announcement, Tuesday's session will also see stocks like Suzlon, Cyient DLM and Coforge react to their respective quarterly results.Bajaj Finance, Hindustan Unilever are some Nifty constituents reporting results on the Union Budget day, along with broader market names like DCM Shriram, Kajaria Ceramics, M&M Financial, ICICI Securities, Torrent Pharma, SRF, Steel Strips Wheels and others.Foreign institutions continued to remain net buyers in the cash market on Monday, while domestic institutions continued to book profits.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said that the Nifty remains above its 20 and 50-Day Simple Moving Average, but the short-term trend for the index remains downwards. He expects further downside on the index once the immediate support of 24,362 is broken, which is Monday's intraday low. Any pullback rallies can find resistance between 24,595 - 24,646 levels.Angel One's Rajesh Bhosale also remains cautious on the index ahead of the Union Budget announcement and advises refraining from aggressive longs. 24,850, followed by 25,000 will remain key barriers for the index. On the downside, 24,200, followed by 24,000 are key support levels.24,500 is a key support for the bulls, while 24,850 can be a primary resistance zone for the traders, said Kotak Securities' Shrikant Chouhan. He said that the if the Nifty slips below the 24,500 mark, can drag the index lower towards 24,150 - 24,000 levels. He advises buying only at the lower levels. In case the Nifty crosses 24,850 on the upside, the Nifty has the potential to advance towards 25,000 - 25,300 levels.The Nifty Bank nearly turned out to be a bigger underperformer on Monday with the index having slipped below the 52,000 mark in early trading. However, the dips were bought into and the index managed to end in the green. While Kotak Bank, SBI and others pulled the index lower, the losses were offset by gains in HDFC Bank. Yet, the index has closed below the 52,500 mark, which has been a key upside hurdle.Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said that the Nifty Bank outlook remains sideways given the current data and prevailing market sentiment. He advises range trading strategies till the index trades between 52,790 - 52,170 levels. He expects further direction on the Nifty bank after it breaks out from either 52,100 or 52,800 levels.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty Bank has formed a bullish candle near short-term swing support and closed above the 21-Day Exponential Moving Average support of 52,064. He expects strong support for the Nifty Bank between 51,800 - 52,000 levels, while 52,800 - 53,000 will act as a barrier.",

It also witnessed its biggest single-day fall since June 4, the day of the Lok Sabha Election results. The question on the street is whether traders would look to book some more profits and remain light on positions ahead of the Union Budget presentation on Tuesday.Even as the Nifty fell over a percent on Friday, it managed to defend Thursday's low of 24,504 by four points and also managed to hold on to marginal gains for the week, which made it the seventh straight weekly gain for the index. Even Infosys, whose ADR, or the US-listed shares ended 8% higher on Thursday night, could not provide support on the upside for the Nifty.Losses on Friday came across the board. Metals were the biggest pain point of the session, followed by the Real Estate names, oil & gas stocks, along with auto companies. Broader markets felt greater pain on Friday with 91 out of 100 Nifty Midcap stocks and 92 out of 100 smallcap stocks ending the session with losses.Therefore, that 24,500 level now becomes the key support on the downside for the Nifty in the all important Union Budget week. The market participants would only be hoping for no negative surprises from Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday.Some uncertainty may also emerge due to comments from both RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das and SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch on the household savings being deployed into speculative activities and rising F&O volumes, which has ignited a widespread debate on the street.As has been the trend in the previous quarter, good earnings have been rewarded by the street, but even the slightest miss has been punished. The reactions to Persistent Systems, Dalmia Bharat on Friday were a case in point.These earnings reactions will continue on Monday courtesy of Reliance Industries, which reported results after market hours on Friday. Wipro will be another reaction to watch out for as the company's US-listed ADRs ended 11.6% lower on Friday. The stock had also received multiple upgrades ahead of its results, which ended up disappointing the street.Other earnings reactions include those from the big boy of the Nifty 50, HDFC Bank, and other banking names like Yes Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and RBL Bank, in addition to stocks like JSW Steel, Indian Hotels, and Oberoi Realty.While Monday's session will not have any significant Nifty earnings, broader market names like Suzlon, along with PSU Banks like Indian Overseas Bank, UCO Bank and IDBI Bank will report results along with stocks like Coforge and Cyient DLM.Foreign institutions continued to remain net buyers in Friday's session, while domestic institutions continued to book profits.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said that the candle pattern formed on the Nifty after Friday's session could be considered a shooting star type pattern, which indicates the possibility of more weakness in the market. He said 24,200 and 24,000 will be a key support for the Nifty, followed by resistance at the 24,850 mark.At the record high, the Nifty has formed a shooting star on the weekly chart and a bearish engulfing pattern on the daily chart, said Osho Krishnan of Angel One. He said that this could mean a shift in trend or a temporary pause in the current upward momentum. A slip below 24,500 can lead to the Nifty falling towards its 20-DEMA level of 24,200, while 24,000 is the key support. 24,800 - 24,850 on the upside can act as a barrier.Kotak Securities' Amol Athawale said that the current market texture is non-directional and that 24,500 will be a key support for the traders. But a slip below 24,350 on the downside could change sentiments and traders may exit their longs. On the upside, 24,850 - 25,000 remains a barrier.After a day of closing above the 52,500 mark, it was back to square one for the Nifty Bank as that index too sold off in-line with the broader market trend. The index will be in greater focus on Monday as most of its constituents either react to or will be reporting results. The Nifty Bank has now corrected over 1,000 points from the record high of 53,357, which it had hit on July 4.The Nifty Bank closed at the day's low, forming a bearish candlestick on the daily chart, said Rupak De of LKP Securities, advising traders to maintain a sell-on-rise strategy with 52,500 being a key overhead resistance. He anticipates further weakness if the Nifty bank closes below the 21-Day Exponential Moving Average of 52,500.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities observed the formation of a bearish harami pattern on the daily candle, indicating short-term weakness. The index is near its key support level of 52,100, which if breached on a closing basis can extend the fall towards 51,700. He also advises maintaining a sell-on-rise strategy on the Nifty Bank for the short-term.",

But then the weekly options expiry plays came into force and took the index not only past 24,600, but also 24,700 and even 24,800 on the upside, registering a new record high of 24,837. The index closed exactly at 24,800 on Thursday, now just 200 points away from the historic 25,000 mark.In case the Nifty does manage to get to 25,000 on the final trading day of this truncated week, it will be the fastest 1,000 point rally on record for the index, which would have taken only 15 trading sessions, including that of Friday. The Nifty had first scaled the mark of 24,000 on June 27 this year.But what caused this turnaround in the Nifty on the weekly options expiry day and that too in the final two hours of the session? IT. Technology stocks led the charge on the upside, with heavyweights Infosys and TCS being substantial contributors. Both combined contributed to nearly 50 points on the Nifty's 190-point surge on Thursday. Vital contributions also came from ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries.And it possibly would be Infosys, that will be the biggest trigger for pushing the Nifty towards 25,000 on Friday. The IT giant convincingly surpassed analyst estimates for the June quarter, raised its revenue growth guidance for financial year 2025 and also won deals worth $4.1 billion during the June quarter. The company's US-listed shares (ADRs) ended 8.3% higher overnight.Other than Infosys, the other stock in focus on Friday will be Reliance Industries, as it will report results after market hours. The index heavyweight will see the reaction to its earnings next Monday, a day before the announcement of the Union Budget.Plenty of other broader market names like Persistent Systems, Tata Technologiues, L&T Technology Services, South Indian Bank, Dalmia Bharat, JSW Infra will also be reacting to their results on Friday.JSW Steel, ICICI Lombard, JSW Energy, Indian Hotels, UltraTech, Wipro, Paytm, Nippon Life AMC, Patanjali Foods, PVR Inox, Route Mobile, Tejas Networks will also be reporting results on Friday.For the week, the Nifty is up 1.2% so far and is poised for a seventh straight weekly advance, which will be the longest weekly stretch seen by the index in 2024.Foreign institutions were heavy net buyers in the cash market, while domestic institutions chose to book profits ahead of the Union Budget for yet another day.The Nifty reaching 25,000 ahead of the Union Budget is a mere formality, said Sameet Chavan of Angel One. However, with key technical indicators in extreme overbought territory and few moving averages deviating far away from the prices, he advises short-term traders to take some money off the table and avoid aggressive bets for a while.Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal believes that the momentum on the Nifty is likely to extend towards 2,5,000 and 25,250 zone. The options data is indicating an immediate Nifty range between 24,600 - 25,000. He advises option traders to initiate a Bull Call Spread by buying one lot of 24,800 Call and selling one lot of 24,3200 Call to continue with the bullish bias in the market.HDFC Securities' Nagaraj Shetti said that the Nifty is nearing a key overhead resistance of 24,960, which is the 1.786% Fibonacci Extension, taken from the bottom of March 2023, the top of September 2023 and October of 2023. Therefore, he expects some consolidation between the 24,950 - 25,000 levels in the short-term.After multiple failed attempts, the Nifty Bank finally managed to close above the mark of 52,500 led by gains in ICICI Bank, SBI and Kotak Mahindra Bank. The index managed to retest levels of 52,800 which has been a key overhead resistance but reversed from those levels, ending with gains of over 200 points. For the week, the index is up 0.6% and is looking to get back to winning ways after snapping an eight-week gaining streak last week. Yet, it remains an underperformer compared to the Nifty's moves.Although the Nifty Bank has remained rangebound for the last nine sessions, it is now inching higher, as suggested by the MACD indicator, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. It has formed a bullish candle with a large body and a smaller wick and remains above the 10 and 20-Day Exponential Moving Averages. Immediate support is at 52,200 and a break above 52,800 will lead to new highs in the coming sessions, he said.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates believes that as long as the Nifty Bank remains above 52,000, the ongoing bullish momentum is likely to continue. On the upside, 52,800 and 53,000 are strong levels of resistance.Nifty 50's July futures added 4.9% or 7.02 lakh shares in Open Interest on Thursday. They are now trading at a premium of 8.2 points from 31 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's July futures shed 0.7% or 14,265 shares in Open Interest on Thursday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.41 from 1.25 earlier.Bandhan Bank, HAL, India Cements and SAIL have entered the F&O ban today.Chambal Fertilisers is out of the ban.Balrampur Chini, GMR Infra, GNFC, Hindustan Copper, Piramal Enterprises, RBL Bank and Vedanta remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes of 24,800 and 25,000 have seen Open Interest addition for next week's monthly F&O expiry.",

The market will resume trading on Thursday after a mid-week holiday.Even as the Nifty traded in a narrow 80-point band on Tuesday, it made a new record high of 24,661 and the intraday low of 24,588 was also higher compared to Monday's low.Earnings continue to remain the key driver for the market as reactions to those continue. Global cues have been benign, particularly in the US markets, with the rotation out of megacap tech stocks, which began last week, continued on Tuesday as well.The Dow Jones hit a record high, the Nasdaq underperformed, while the Smallcap Russell 2000 index gained another 3% on Tuesday. Wall Street will be open for trading on Wednesday and hence, Indian equities will react to two days of data from the US markets.With Tuesday's high, the Nifty is up nearly 3,500 points in just 29 trading sessions since June 4, which was the day the Lok Sabha election results were declared and the index had declined by 6%.Thursday is also the weekly options expiry of the Nifty 50 contracts. Earnings reaction will also be seen in stocks like Asian Paints, Just Dial, LTIMindtree, Hathaway Cables, Elcon Engineering and others.There are also a host of Nifty and broader market earnings scheduled to be reported on Thursday, including Infosys, Persistent Systems, Polycab, Havells India, JSW Steel, JSW Infra, Tata Technologies, Newgen Software, South Indian Bank, Rallis India, Swaraj Engines among others.Foreign investors continued to remain net buyers in the cash market on Tuesday, while domestic institutions continued to book profits.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities continues to maintain that the Nifty will touch levels of 24,900 in the coming week as there is no significant reversal pattern building at the record high levels. Immediate support on the downside is at 24,450.24,665 will now be the immediate breakout for the bulls, above which, the Nifty can move towards levels of 24,775. On the flip side, a quick intraday fall may be seen if the Nifty sustains below 24,500. That fall can take the index lower to levels of 24,425, said Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities.Angel One's Osho Krishnan said that the current support zone for the Nifty is between 24,500 - 24,400, which may see the buyers step in if there is a dip towards that level. However, it is not entirely clear that the trend will sustain at higher levels. A sustained move above 24,610 can take the Nifty higher towards 24,700 - 24,750 levels.It was yet another sluggish day for the Nifty Bank too as the index continued to underperform the Nifty. The banking index continues to find resistance above the mark of 52,500 and is struggling to sustain above it even after crossing it intraday for three sessions in a row, including Tuesday's weekly expiry session. Contrary to the Nifty, the Nifty Bank has been making lower highs on its charts.The Nifty Bank is witnessing a possible accumulation phase as the index remains above the key support level of 52,000 and above the 20-Day Exponential Moving Average of 51,900. The trend will only weaken on a slip below 51,750, while a rise above 52,800 will indicate continuation of a bullish trend.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty Bank is consolidating in a narrow band but is holding above the 21-Day Exponential Moving Average, which is near the 51,960 mark, while the recent swing low is near 51,750. He advises using a buy-on-dips strategy on the index till it holds above 51,750. On the upside, 52,800 and 53,000 are key support levels.Nifty 50's July futures added 0.6% or 78,700 shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. They are now trading at a premium of 31 points from 35 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's July futures shed 4.3% or 93,315 shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. Nifty 50's Put-Call ratio is now at 1.25 from 1.33 earlier.Balrampur Chini, Piramal Enterprises and Vedanta have entered the F&O ban.Aditya Birla Fashion, India Cements and Indus Towers have exited the F&O ban.Chambal Fertilisers, GMR Infra, GNFC, Hindustan Copper and RBL Bank continue to remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,650 and 24,800 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,400 and 24,650 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.",

It has almost become a pattern of sorts for the Nifty to come every morning, make new highs, close off the highs but end the session with gains and another record closing level. Monday, the start of this new, truncated week, was no different. Even as the Nifty traded in a 110-point range, it crossed the 24,600 mark, made a new high of 24,635, and closed above levels of 24,550.Interestingly, barring SBI and ITC, none of the major index heavyweights contributed to the Nifty's upmove on Monday. Most of them ended with a flat to negative bias. But contributions came from PSUs like ONGC and NTPC, along with Bajaj Auto, which reports results on Tuesday.For the Nifty though, while the range remains narrow, the base continues to move higher. The index made a higher low on the daily chart for the third straight session, meaning the intraday low of that particular session was higher than the previous one.Tuesday might turn out to be a volatile day for the financials, as the Nifty Financial Services will have its weekly expiry. Additionally, with Wednesday being a market holiday, the Nifty Bank too, will have its weekly expiry on Tuesday.Stocks like Jio Financial Services and SpiceJet will also be reacting to their quarterly results reported after market hours on Monday. Besides Bajaj Auto, stocks like CRISIL, Dee Development Engineers, DB Corp, Himadri Speciality Chemicals, Jubilant Ingrevia, Just Dial, L&T Finance, Network18 and TV18 will report their June quarter results on Tuesday.Foreign institutions continued to remain net buyers in the cash market, while domestic institutions booked profits at higher levels.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities maintains that the Nifty is poised to test levels of 24,950 in the next one week.\"Normally such doji formations after a reasonable upmove and at hurdles considered as an impending reversal signal from the highs post confirmation. But, having formed this pattern amidst a range movement, the significant negative anticipation could be less,\" he added. Immediate downside support is at 24,450.Angel One's Osho Krishnan said that 24,610 is the \"golden retracement zone\" for the Nifty where it has formed a Doji formation, meaning indecisiveness at record high levels. A break above that zone can boost further momentum. On the downside, 24,500 - 24,400 will be immediate supports, followed by 24,150.\"Technically, the index formed a doji candle near the resistance zone, indicating uncertainty. Thus, the high of this doji candle, which is around 24,635 will act as a short-term hurdle for the index. If the index manages to close above it, then the rally can extend towards the 24,800-25,000 levels,\" said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates.Most of the gains on the Nifty Bank came via SBI and other PSU banks on Monday as most of the heavyweight private banks underperformed. However, despite making a high above the 56,600 mark, the index could not sustain above it, and ended below the recent resistance of 52,500.The Nifty Bank trades in a narrow range but remains above the crucial support level of 52,000, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. The index will weaken if it slips below the rising trendline support of 51,750, while a move above 52,800 will resume the bullish trend. He advises using any short-term correction as a buying opportunity.Rupak De of LKP Securities believes that it is important for the Nifty Bank to move above 52,500 in the initial hour of trade as a failure to do so might attract selling pressure on Tuesday. A sustained move above 52,500 can take the index back to 53,000.Nifty 50's July futures added 2.6% or 3.62 lakh shares in Open Interest on Monday. They are now trading at a premium of 35 points from 19.45 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's July futures added 4.4% or 92,130 shares in Open Interest on Monday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.33 from 1.27 earlier.Hindustan Copper has entered the F&O ban.Bandhan Bank, Balrampur Chini, Piramal Enterprises and IEX are out of the F&O ban.Aditya Birla Fashion, Chambal Fertilisers, GMR Airports, GNFC, India Cements, Indus Towers and RBL Bank continue to remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,600 and 25,000 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,500 and 24,600 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.",

The week gone by nearly turned out to be a dull one until the IT stocks woke up from their long slumber post TCS' results and took the Nifty higher, thereby ensuring that the index gained for the sixth week in a row.The Nifty IT index had its best single day gain since October 2020 last Friday. Out of the 186 points that the Nifty rallied on the final trading day of the week, 129, or nearly 70% of that came from the six IT stocks - TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, Tech Mahindra and LTIMindtree. The other contributors to the upside were stocks like Reliance Industries and Axis Bank.At one point, the Nifty not only broke past 24,500 on the upside, but came within touching distance of even conquering 24,600. The index though, reversed from its latest record high of 24,592 but managed to close above the mark of 24,500. For the week, the Nifty ended 0.7% higher.HCLTech, which was the only IT stocks that was not participating in Friday's rally in the initial bits of trading, recovered from the day's low and also ended with gains of 3%. The stock will now react to its quarterly results, which were reported after market hours on Friday. Also reacting to their results will be stocks like Avenue Supermarts and IREDA, among others.Monday's trading session will see stocks like HDFC AMC, HDFC Life and Jio Financial Services report results.The US markets too rebounded from Thursday's dip with the Dow Jones scaling a new record past the mark of 40,000. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also gained 0.5% and 0.6% respectively. There might just be a reaction in the markets post the shootout at former President Donald Trump's rally, in which he was injured.Friday's trading session saw foreign institutions be net buyers in the cash market, while domestic institutions continued to book profits at higher levels.The Nifty appears to have completed its one day dip and has started to move higher, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities, while pointing to a similar move on June 24, post which the index had continued to move higher. He now expects the index to test levels of 24,950, having crossed the immediate hurdle of 24,400. Downside support is at 24,350.Kotak Securities' Amol Athawale is of the view that 24,400 - 24,350 will be key supports for trend following traders and moves above that will take the Nifty to 24,650 - 24,750 levels. Only a slip below these levels can take the index back to 24,200 - 24,150.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty nearly tested its short-term target of 24,600 and will now have to cross that level to trigger fresh bullish momentum. Till then, he advised considering buying on every dip with support seen near levels of 24,170.The Nifty Bank remained an underperformer as had been the case all through last week. The index remained little changed on Friday and managed to end the week with losses of close to 0.7%. With that, the eight-week winning streak of the Nifty Bank came to an end. Although the index did see a spike above the mark of 52,500, in line with the Nifty moves, it could not sustain above those levels, correcting over 500 points from the highs.The Nifty Bank found support from the rising trendline, which continues to highlight a positive trend, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. He also expects a short-term pullback on the index, where if 51,800 is broken on the downside, it can head further down towards 51,200.Rupak De of LKP Securities said that the Nifty Bank continues to face resistance at the 52,800 mark and in case it manages to break and sustain above those levels, it can move further higher towards 54,000.Nifty 50's July futures added 2% or 2.76 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday. They are now trading at a premium of 19.45 points from 66.7 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's July futures shed 4% or 92,370 shares in Open Interest on Friday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.27 from 1.29 earlier.GMR Infra has entered the F&O ban from today.Aditya Birla Fashion, Bandhan Bank, Balrampur Chini, Chambal Fertilisers, GNFC, IEX, India Cements, indus Towers, Piramal Enterprises, and RBL Bank continue to remain in the F&O ban.For this Thursday's weekly options expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes between 24,500 and 25,000 have seen Open Interest addition.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,300 and 24,500 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.",

The Nifty continues to find support between 24,150 - 24,200 levels and continues to face hurdles at the 24,400 mark. That has been the pattern all through this week and the weekly options expiry session was no different.Traders have been happy to play the range as the market looks for more directional cues. On the global front, hopes are rising that the US Federal Reserve will eventually bite the bullet and start cutting interest rates by September. Back home, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das, in an exclusive interaction with CNBC-TV18, said that it is too soon to think of interest rate cuts.The bulls would hope that the Nifty finally catches up some pace on the final trading week on Friday after a strong quarterly show by India's largest IT services company, TCS. The performance from TCS may have a rub-off effect on other IT companies too, five others of which are part of the Nifty 50. Of course, the IT index would need support from other index heavyweights as well, who have had an indifferent week themselves.Besides TCS, stocks like Anand Rathi Wealth and GTPL Hathaway will also react to their quarterly results reported after market hours on Thursday. The other IT major, HCLTech will be reporting results after market hours on Friday.Foreign investors were net sellers in the cash market on Thursday, while domestic investors were net buyers. For the week, the Nifty is absolutely flat.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities feels like the odds of an upside bounce remains likely in the short-term as the Nifty has been bouncing from its 10-Day Exponential Moving Average support. The underlying trend though, remains choppy with a positive bias. Only a sustained move above 24,500 will open doors for 24,900, while immediate support is at 24,150.The next directional move in the Nifty will come only once it breaks out from the 24,150 - 24,450 zone, said Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One. He still advises booking profits at higher levels and avoiding aggressive longs ahead of the Union Budget. 24,200 - 24,150 remains a key support and a break below that may trigger a further correction.Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates' Hrishikesh Yedve believes that the Nifty will continue to find resistance near 24,460. Sustaining above these levels can trigger an upmove towards 24,550 - 24,600 levels. On the downside, 24,170 and 24,000 are supports for the index.The Nifty Bank has been an underperformer this week and an eight week winning streak is under threat of being snapped. For the week so far, the nifty bank is down 0.7% and still remains in the 52,000 - 52,500 range which it has struggled to cross this week. However, the index did see a slip below the 52,000 mark on Thursday on an intraday basis, which it managed to recovery from by over 500 points by the close. On the charts, the Nifty Bank has been making lower lows for the last two trading sessions.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities also said that the Nifty Bank slipped below its 10-Day Moving Average and is showcasing lower lows and lower highs, suggesting a bearish trend. The immediate support is at 52,000, which aligns with the 20-Day Moving Average. The weakness may persist if the Nifty Bank sustains below the 51,900 mark. A move above 52,530 can trigger a rebound towards 53,000 - 53,200 on the upside.If the Nifty manages to hold 52,000 - 51,800 levels on the downside, a pullback towards 52,500 is possible, said Rupak De of LKP Securities. However, failure to hold 51,800 can lead to a further decline towards 51,300 - 51,000 zone.Nifty 50's July futures shed 3.1% and 4.3 lakh shares in Open Interest on Thursday. They are trading at a premium of 66.7 points from 30.6 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's July futures shed 7.2% or 1.7 lakh shares in Open Interest on Thursday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.29 from 0.97 earlier.Aditya Birla Fashion, Bandhan Bank, Piramal Enterprises, GNFC, RBL Bank, India Cements, Chambal Fertlilisers, Indus Towers, Balrampur Chini, IEX continue to remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,200 and 25,000 have seen Open Interest addition for next Thursday's weekly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,200 and 23,500 saw Open Interest addition for next Thursday's weekly expiry.",

When someone would read the first line, they may wonder that the Nifty had a pretty significant drop in mid-week trading. But that drop was only 0.5%. Such has been the market and the recovery seen by the index since the 6% drop that day in June.In the 24 trading sessions since June 4, excluding the one on Wednesday, the Nifty has declined in only six of them, with the biggest drop being 0.3%, which came on June 21. The dip on Wednesday also came after the Nifty made a new high of 24,461 in early trade.Despite the drop on Wednesday, the market continued with its \"buy-the-dip\" trend. At one point, the Nifty even slipped below the mark of 24,150 but saw a recovery of nearly 200 points from those levels to close above the 24,300 mark. Most index heavyweights, be it Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank or TCS were on the same losing end in Wednesday's trade, although the recovery in the index also came as the first two recovered from their respective session's low.And TCS will remain in focus on Thursday as it kickstarts the earnings season for the Nifty 50 companies, the reaction of which of course, will be seen on Friday. What may not please investors here is that while HDFC Bank and Reliance recovered significantly from their day's low, TCS did not do so and ended nearly 2% lower ahead of results.Thursday is also the weekly options expiry of the Nifty 50 contracts and it remains to be seen whether the recovery made late on Wednesday is sustained or some expiry related volatility will lead to a retest of Wednesday's low, which also happens to be the lowest since July 1.Both foreign and domestic investors continued to be net buyers in the cash market on Wednesday but that number could also be skewed due to the block deals seen in Delhivery and Mankind Pharma.The near-term uptrend of the Nifty remains intact but the market seems to have started to show signs of profit booking between 24,400 - 24,500 levels, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. A move above 24,465 though, would negate these bearish setups on the Nifty. Immediate downside support is at 24,150.Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One said that current prices remain elevated and within a range, indicating that participants are awaiting a catalyst for a decisive move. He said that any disappointing results may trigger the overdue price correction. 24,100 - 24,500 now becomes the range to observe for the weekly expiry on Thursday.Technically, the Nifty has englufed Tuesday's bullish candle and formed a hanging man candle near the all-time high, which means 24,461 will now be a short-term hurdle for the index, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. On the downside 24,200 - 24,000 will be a strong support.The Nifty Bank has now declined in three out of the last four trading sessions. In the four sessions since it hit a record high of 53,357, the index has corrected by over 1,000 points, led primarily by HDFC Bank. During the weekly options expiry session, the Nifty Bank managed to defend the 52,000 mark on the downside.The Nifty Bank now has immediate downside support at 51,990 and a break of that can lead to a decline towards levels of 51,300 or even 51,200 on the downside, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. The 10-day moving average of 52,600 will be a key upside barrier and a fall in the RSI from 60 to 57 also indicates weakening of the primary trend.Kunal Shah of LKP Securities said that Call writers are active at the 52,500 strike for the Nifty Bank leading to the index struggling to cross that mark. The index is now at a crucial support zone of 52,000 - 51,800 and a holding of that level can lead to a pullback towards 52,500. However, a break below the support zone can see downside levels of 51,300 or even 51,000.Nifty 50's July futures shed 2.8% and 4.1 lakh shares in Open Interest on Wednesday. They are now trading at a premium of 30.6 points from 52.45 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's July futures shed 9% and 2.3 lakh shares in Open Interest on Wednesday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 0.97 from 1.28 earlier.RBL Bank has entered the F&O ban today.Aditya Birla Fashion, Bandhan Bank, Piramal Enterprises, GNFC, India Cements, Chambal Fertilisers, Indus Towers, Balrampur Chini and IEX continue to remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,300 and 24,600 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.On the Put side, while the 24,400 strike saw Open Interest shedding, others between 23,900 and 24,200 saw addition in Open Interest for this Thursday's expiry.",

What will give the bulls more confidence is that the index sustained at those levels and closed near the day's high.Even as the index made a new high, it remained in a narrow range, 110 points to be precise on Tuesday. There were enough index constituents that pushed the index higher to newer records on Tuesday, even as Reliance Industries underperformed after keeping the index losses in check over the last few trading sessions.Auto majors Maruti and Mahindra & Mahindra, along with ICICI Bank and ITC led the index to newer peaks. ITC gained for the fifth day in a row, and is attempting a retest of its previous highs after a few months of sideways price action. The Nifty Auto index was also the top sectoral performer of the day, ending at record levels.The broader markets also moved in tandem with the benchmark indices but there were pockets that outperformed. Barring auto, PSU banks made a comeback after a few days of underperformance, while Pharma resumed its uptrend from the week gone by. IT and Metals had a dull day on Tuesday.On the flip side, the high flyers of the last one month saw some profit booking on Tuesday. Railway stocks had all opened higher but corrected significantly towards close. RVNL, IRCON, IRFC, all of them ended the day with losses. The other pocket which saw some correction on Tuesday were shipbuilders. All three of them, Mazagon Dock, Cochin Shipyard and Garden Reach ended with losses between 3% and 5%.Summarising the current market mood, veteran investor Vijay Kedia had a warning. You can read more on that here. There is no doubt that the market is sitting in anticipation of further cues from the IT earnings that begin this Thursday. Till then, the focus remains on the globe as to how the US markets, having made new record highs almost every single day, react to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony.Both foreign and domestic institutions were net buyers in the cash market on Tuesday.For the trend following traders, 24,350 is a key support for the Nifty, said Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities, who expects a move to 24,500 - 24,555, till the Nifty trades above 24,350. The higher levels will act as a barrier for the index.Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One advises against aggressive long positions as the setups are overbought. He said that key levels to watch on the Nifty would be 24,600 - 24,650, which will be the golden ratio retracement of the panic fall seen during the election result day. On the downside, 24,330, followed by 24,160 will be key support levels.Just as the Nifty is stuck between the tug-of-war of its two heavyweights - Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank, the Nifty Bank is facing a similar test between HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank. On Tuesday, ICICI Bank and SBI prevailed with HDFC Bank not participating on either side of the spectrum. The index also closed above the 52,500 mark. Wednesday will also be the weekly options expiry, which will keep the index in focus.The Nifty Bank is stuck in a range of 52,700 on the upside and 52,100 on the downside and a breakout on either side will lead to trending moves, said Kunal Shah of LKP Securities. The index remains in buy-on-dips mode and a break above 52,700 will take the index back to 53,000, where there is significant Open Interest on the Call side. On the other hand, a break below 52,100 - 52,000 can drag the Nifty Bank to 51,700 - 51,500 on the downside.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates observed that the Nifty Bank has formed a bullish engulfing candle near the lower-end of the short-term consolidation. Therefore, 52,200 - 52,000 will be a strong support and as long as the index remains above this level, it can retest 53,000 - 53,200 levels.Nifty 50's July futures added 1.6% and 2.3 lakh shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. They are now trading at a premium of 52.45 points from 55.05 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's July futures shed 0.3% and 8,805 shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.28 from 1.18 earlier.Balrampur Chini and IEX have entered the F&O Ban.Hindustan Copper is out of the F&O ban.Aditya Birla Fashion, Bandhan Bank, Piramal Enterprises, GNFC, India Cements, Chambal Fertilisers and Indus Towers continue to remain in the F&O ban.For Thursday's weekly options expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes of 24,400 and 24,700 saw Open Interest addition, while the 24,300 and 24,350 strikes saw shedding in Open Interest.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,100 and 24,400 saw Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.",

The index has remained in the range of 24,170 on the downside and 24,400 on the upside. Every instance that the index has seen a dip due to one stock or sector, another stock or sector has ensured it pulls it back higher.On Friday, when HDFC Bank pulled the Nifty down, Reliance pulled it higher. HDFC Bank again pulled the Nifty down on Monday, supported ably by Titan, but Reliance Industries yet again, supported by ITC, ensured the dip was bought into and the index ended in the green yet again.There has been no decisive move on either side as traders are content playing the range as of now. But the question is, for how long is this likely to continue? The index is awaiting a trigger on either side for a decisive move beyond this range.Beyond the index, there has been plenty of stock specific action within the broader markets. Rail PSUs saw buying on Monday and many hit record high levels. The Nifty PSE index too is now just 100 points away from recovering all the losses it made on June 4 this year. Fertiliser and FMCG stocks too saw buying and names which had coverage initiations from various brokerages like DOMS Industries and HUDCO also had a good day at the office.The triggers come in towards the end of the week with TCS reporting results on Thursday after market hours, followed by HCLTech on Friday. In the interim, business updates from various companies continue to which there will be reaction as well. Tuesday is also the expiry of the financial services index, which will keep the Nifty Bank in focus.Both, foreign and domestic institutional investors were net buyers in the cash market on Monday.Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One reiterated that a correction is likely in the near term, either price-wise or time-wise. The immediate trading range is seen between 24,200 and 24,500, with key levels extending to 24,000 to 24,600. Any dip towards the lower end would be a buying opportunity, whereas any upside toward the mentioned resistance should prompt traders to book profits,\" he said.Meanwhile, senior technical research analyst Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said the short term trend of Nifty continues to be positive. \"There is a possibility of continuation of this range movement for the next one or two sessions before witnessing further upmove above 24,400 levels. A sustained move above 24,400 can open further upside for the market.Shrikant Chouhan, the head of equity research at Kotak Securities believes the intraday non-directional activity indicates indecisiveness between the bulls and the bears. \"We are of the view that the intraday market texture is non-directional, perhaps traders are waiting for either side breakout,\" he said.Chouhan said for the bulls, 24,360 will be the key level for the Nifty, above which, it can move towards 24,450 - 24,500 levels. A slip below 24,290 though, can drag the Nifty down to 24,160 - 24,120 levels.For the Nifty Bank, the index has declined over 600 points in the last two trading sessions, courtesy of the decline seen in HDFC Bank. Monday also saw the index underperform the Nifty as the slide in its largest constituent continued. HDFC Bank's shares were up 5% between Monday and Wednesday of last week. Within the next three sessions, the stock has declined over 7% and is now the biggest contributor to the downside for the Nifty Bank.Rupak De, senior technical analyst, LKP Securities, said Bank Nifty closed below its support level of 52,500, forming a small-bodied candlestick on the daily chart. \"The trend however, remains positive as it closed above the critical moving average. Strong support level is at 52,000 where Put writers are present heavily. While the Call writers seen heaving position at 52,500. A close above 52,500 might induce a sustained rally towards 53,000,\" De said.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty Bank continues to consolidate in the range of 52,000 to 53,200 and only a breakout on either side will indicate further directional moves for the index.Nifty 50's July futures added 0.5% and 67,950 shares in Open Interest on Monday. They are currently trading at a premium of 55.05 points from 55.55 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's July futures shed 0.8% and 21,000 shares in Open Interest on Monday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 1.18 from 1.2 earlier.Chambal Fertilisers and Indus Towers have entered the F&O ban.Aditya Birla Fashion, Bandhan Bank, Piramal Enterprises, GNFC, India Cements and Hindustan Copper continue to remain in the F&O ban.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 23,700 and 23,950 saw Open Interest addition, while the 23,500 strike saw shedding in Open Interest for this Thursday's weekly expiry.",

The two stocks being Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank, while IT was the theme that continued to hog the limelight. If one took the market higher, the other ensured that the gains were kept in check and vice versa. In three out of the five trading sessions last week, it was IT, that lent support to the market.And while on Friday it felt as if the Nifty would eventually snap its streak of gains with some profit booking at higher levels courtesy of the fall in HDFC Bank and a no-show from IT, it was a sharp spike in Reliance Industries towards the close of trade that triggered a swift recovery in the index, ensuring that it ended in the green.With HDFC Bank being the only one pulling the Nifty lower after a weak quarterly business update, Reliance, L&T, SBI and HUL contributed to the recovery. For the week, the Nifty ended with gains of 1.3%.Wall Street resumed trading on Friday after a holiday and the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq posted yet another record close. The jobs report released on Friday pointed to a 2,06,000 increase in non-farm payrolls in June, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.1%, slightly higher than estimates of 4%. The jobs report pointed to increased hopes of a rate cut from the US Federal Reserve soon.Multiple stocks will react to their quarterly business updates that were reported on Friday and over the weekend such as Titan, IndusInd Bank, Marico, Dabur and others. Earnings season also begins in the upcoming week with TCS reporting results on July 11, followed by HCLTech on July 12.Friday's session saw foreign institutions continue to remain net buyers in the cash market, while domestic institutions continued to book profits at higher levels.Amol Athawale of Kotak Securities wrote that for traders, 24,100 will become an important support zone for the Nifty, followed by 24,000, while 24,400 - 24,500 on the upside will act as a barrier for the index. He added that below 24,000, traders will exit from their long positions.The Nifty has formed a bullish candle on the daily chart with a minor upper and lower shadow, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. Technically, this market action signals formation of a bullish counterattack type candle pattern and a similar formation on June 24 had resulted in a sustained upmove in the coming weeks. He expects an upside breakout from 24,400 - 24,500 levels in the coming sessions, with 24,170 being a support on the downside.Angel One's Osho Krishnan said that 24,200 is likely to provide a cushion for short-term blips, followed by 24,000. He expects 24,400 - 24,500 to be a resistance and the Nifty to consolidate for the next few sessions.On a day when HDFC Bank falls over 4%, there is very little to expect for the Nifty Bank in terms of a recovery, even as the other banking stocks tried their best to put their hand up. If it was HDFC Bank that led the gains during the initial part of the week, it led it lower on Thursday and Friday as well. Yet, the Nifty Bank managed to post weekly gains of 0.6%, having recovered nearly 400 points from the lows of the day.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities believes that in case the Nifty Bank slips below levels of 51,990 on the downside, it can be pushed further towards levels of 51,700, where a strong support lies. He expects the index to consolidate in the coming days and only a move above 53,100 will mark a resumption of the uptrend.The Nifty Bank is currently stuck in a range with resistance visible between 53,000 - 53,200 levels, where aggressive call writing has been observed, said Kunal Shah of LKP Securities. Support on the downside is between 52,300 - 52,100. He expects a breakout on either side to result in trending moves. Within the range, the trend remains bullish and he advises using dips as buying opportunities.Nifty 50's July futures shed 2.6% or 3.7 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday. They are now trading at a premium of 55.55 points compared to 57.3 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's July futures shed 6.6% and 1.9 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 1.2 from 1.27 earlier.GNFC has entered the F&O ban.Aditya Birla Fashion, Bandhan Bank, Piramal Enterprises, India Cements and Hindustan Copper remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,600 and 24,800 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,000 to 24,200 saw Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry, along with the 23,500 strike.",

A street favourite suddenly becomes the most neglected stock and a stock that lead the market higher, suddenly becomes the reason for the market to move lower. HDFC Bank is a case in point. After leading the Nifty higher for the better part of this week considering the positive newsflow, it appears as if the street is now done with it, and will wait for the actual event before deciding on the next course of action.HDFC Bank was the biggest contributor to the Nifty downside on Thursday, a complete reversal from Wednesday's upmove. On the other end, was ICICI Bank, which ensured that the former could not drag the Nifty further down. As a result of this tug-of-war, the Nifty traded in a 120-point range on its weekly expiry, but ended absolutely flat.And HDFC Bank will remain in focus on Friday as well as the lender will react to its quarterly business update which it released late Thursday evening. The market will continue to react to these business updates, which we'll highlight in our stocks to watch section. There will be no overnight cues apart from the UK election outcome as Wall Street is shut on account of the independence day holiday.For the week, the Nifty is up by 1.2% and is poised for its fifth straight weekly advance and the bulls would hope that HDFC Bank does not spoil the party. 24,401 has now become the new high for the Nifty.Foreign investors continued to remain net buyers in the cash market on Thursday, while the domestic investors continued to book some profits at higher levels for the second straight session.Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities said that the Nifty is currently in a non-directional zone at higher levels as traders are waiting for either side of a breakout. 24,400 will be the immediate breakout level for day traders, above which, he expects the Nifty to head towards 24,500 - 24,525. On the flip side, a fall below 24,280 can take the Nifty back down to 24,200 - 24,165 levels.Even if the Nifty is placed near record high levels, there is no confirmation of a reversal pattern forming on the charts, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. He expects some more consolidation or a minor dip from 24,400 levels in the coming sessions. The 10-Day Exponential Moving Average is placed at 23,990 levels.Angel One's Osho Krishnan wrote that the highs of 24,400 can be an immediate hurdle for the Nifty, while on the lower end of the spectrum, 24,200 - 24,150 will be a key support level, followed by 24,000. He advises caution considering the overbought scenarios on the charts and focus on stock-specific activity instead.Similar to the Nifty, the Nifty Bank also recovered from the lows of the day, led by a recovery in ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank. Many banking stocks will be reacting to their business updates on Friday, including PNB, and that may also influence the movement on the index, and thereby on the Nifty. So far for the week, the Nifty Bank is up 1.4% for the week and is poised for its eighth straight weekly advance.The Nifty Bank needs to sustain above the 53,000 mark, which will confirm the ongoing uptrend towards 53,400 - 53,600 levels, said Kunal Shah of LKP Securities.

Since then, the Nifty has made one record high after another, rallying over 3,000 points in just a month.The market made new records on Wednesday as well, but that was on expected lines as HDFC Bank was meant to lead the market rally post the positive news developments. But it was not only HDFC Bank, other banking stocks also put their hand up in contributing towards the gains.The Sensex crossed 80,000 on Wednesday , marking its fastest 10,000-point rally, having hit 70,000 only in December last year. Such was the dominance of financials in Wednesday's session, that the top six contributors to the Nifty gains were all banking names, led by HDFC Bank and supported by ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and State Bank of India While it was the banks that led the charge on the upside, the other index heavyweights like Reliance Industries, TCS and Larsen & Toubro kept the gains in check. What may give more encouragement to the bulls though, is the fact that the Nifty closed just 20 points adrift of the day's high of 24,309, which is also the new record high for the index.Over the next two sessions, the market will deal with a lack of global cues although there are enough and more cues emerging on the macro front, including the FOMC minutes, the Jobless claims and the payrolls data. US markets will remain shut on Thursday due to the independence day holiday.Thursday will also be the weekly options expiry for the Nifty and that may see a further decisive move on either side for the index.Foreign investors were net buyers in the cash market on Wednesday, while domestic investors chose to book some profits at higher levels.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said that having shifted closer to the overhead resistance of 24,400, the Nifty can shift into further consolidation or rangebound moves in the short-term before moving higher. A decisive move above 24,400 though, will open up targets towards 24,900 in the coming weeks. 24,110 now is a key support.The sentiment has yet again shifted towards long trades in the market, said Rupak De of LKP Securities. He expects the index to continue to retain its strength till the time it holds on to levels of 24,000, above which, the Nifty has the potential to move towards 24,500. Only a slip below 24,000 can push the Nifty into consolidation.Kotak Securities' Shrikant Chouhan is of the view that till the Nifty retains the 24,200 level, the upmove could continue towards levels of 24,500. A slip below 24,200 can lead to traders exiting their long positions.Courtesy of HDFC Bank and other banking names, the Nifty Bank too made a new record high of 53,256. But as HDFC Bank cooled off from the highs of the day, the index could not sustain at the higher levels either. Yet, it managed to end its weekly options expiry session with gains of over 900 points. Even underperforming shares like Bandhan Bank were among the top gainers on the Nifty Bank on Wednesday.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities said that the 9-Day Moving Average of 52,400 is an immediate downside support for the Nifty Bank, while on the upside, the 127.8% Fibonacci retracement of 53,550 and 161.8% retracement level of 53,900 will act as barriers for the index.The Nifty Bank is consolidating in the 52,000 - 53,200 range, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. In case the index manages to hold on to 53,200, the rally could extend towards levels of 54,000 - 54,200 on the upside.Nifty 50's July futures shed 0.8% or 1.24 lakh shares in Open Interest on Wednesday. They are now trading at a premium of 63.9 points from 79.3 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's July futures added 13.7% or 3.4 lakh shares in Open Interest on Wednesday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 1.24 from 1.15 earlier.Hindustan Copper has entered the F&O ban.Indus Towers is out of the F&O ban.India Cements continues to remain in the F&O ban.For today's weekly options expiry, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,300 and 24,400 have seen Open Interest addition, while those of 24,100 and 24,150 have seen Open Interest shedding.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,200 and 24,300 have seen Open Interest addition for today's weekly expiry.",

Considering the breakneck speed at which the index has moved through June and on Monday, a little break should not come as any surprise. In the six sessions until Tuesday, the Nifty had risen over 600 points.The Nifty may have ended flat on an absolute basis. But just as they say in cricket, \"There was enough in the pitch for both the batsmen and the bowlers,\" there was enough in the market for the bulls and the bears as well. The Nifty made a new record high of 24,236 earlier in the day, but could not sustain above those levels.Barring heavyweight banks, most of the other banking names were a drag and that ensured the Nifty did not move higher, despite contributions from Reliance Industries and technology heavyweights like Infosys and TCS.The broader markets had a dull day on Tuesday with both the Midcap and Smallcap indices ending with losses. Within the broader markets, paper stocks had a field day after a positive report from ratings agency ICRA. You can read more on that here. On the flip side, broking firms like Angel One, Geojit Financial, and even BSE had a bad day at the office post SEBI's recent circular. More on that here. But while the index heavyweights now split on either side of the spectrum, the road ahead for the Nifty rests on HDFC Bank's shoulders. In the last two sessions, the biggest constituent on the Nifty has risen from levels of \u20b91,680 to \u20b91,730. With the lender having uploaded its shareholding pattern for the June quarter, its weightage in the MSCI indices is set to increase and may result in flows of up to $4 billion. More on that here. Brokerage firm BoFA Securities believes that if FII shareholding dips further, HDFC Bank will be in compliance with FII headroom norms, leading to buying worth \u20b934,000 crore in the stock. That itself, will give a push to the Nifty on the upside. Banks will continue to remain the focal point on Wednesday too as it will be the first weekly expiry of the July series for the Nifty Bank contracts.2For Tuesday's trading session, foreign institutions were net sellers in the cash market, while domestic institutions were net buyers.Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities is expecting one quick intraday correction from current levels due to the temporary overbought conditions on the intraday charts. However, he maintained that the medium-term texture of the market remains positive. For day traders, 24,200 will be an immediate resistance zone and the Nifty may test 24,000 - 23,950 on the downside if it remains below that level.Further consolidation or minor dips from here on the Nifty can be a buying opportunity as the overall trend still remains positive, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. Immediate support on the downside is now at 23,980 and the next upside level to be watched is 24,400. He expects the Nifty to keep moving higher after a consolidation period.Angel One's Osho Krishnan said that 24,250 technically continues to remain a resistance for the Nifty and will be the first hurdle for the bulls to cross. On the downside, 24,000 still is a very significant level and a slip below that could take the Nifty further down to levels of 23,800, which is another key support.The Nifty Bank has lost 1,000 points from the recent record high of 53,180 which it made last Thursday. Despite HDFC Bank's support, the index could not find support at lower levels as the rest of the constituents underperformed. Majority of the losses came from PSU banks. The other interesting bit is the fact that the index has closed at nearly the same levels which are the lows it made during Monday's session and reversed from there.On the daily charts, the Nifty Bank has formed a bearish engulfing pattern. The daily RSI, though at 62, has slipped below its average line, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. The Fibonacci retracement of 23.6% shows immediate support at 51,500 on the downside, with upside resistance at 52,900. Mehra advises using a sell-on-rise strategy.Kunal Shah of LKP Securities said that the Nifty Bank remains in sell-on-rise mode with the next immediate support on the downside at 52,000 - 51,800 levels. In case the index fails to hold these levels, it may see further selling pressure towards 51,400 - 51,300 levels, he added.Nifty 50's July futures added 0.1% or 13,700 shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. They are now trading at a premium of 79.3 points from 64.3 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's July futures shed 2.5% or 62,790 shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.15 from 1.21 earlier.Indus Towers and India Cements continue to remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,200 to 24,550 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 21,400 to 23,800 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry, while the 23,100 strike saw shedding in Open Interest.",

What is common among all of this? Regardless of the sector, something or the other ensures that the Nifty continues to move higher.After a 7% rally on the index in June, there was broad consensus that the index should see some consolidation or a price correction and the signs of that were evident even last Friday. But that was not to be. Indian IT companies, along with HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank ensured that the Nifty gained in fifth out of the last six trading sessions . Monday's close also meant that the Nifty is now just 30 points away from its recent record high of 21,174.Nearly three-quarters, or 73% of the 131 points surge seen by the Nifty on Monday came from both HDFC Bank and ICICI bank, along with the three IT majors - Infosys, TCS and Tech Mahindra. The actual trigger for IT stocks though, was the double upgrade that Wipro received from brokerage firm CLSA. You can read more on that here. Multiple companies reported their quarterly business update for the June quarter during the course of Monday's trading session. They included the likes of Coal India Karur Vysya Bank , and NMDC. As the week goes by, multiple private sector banks and FMCG companies will also be reporting their business updates for the street to have an inkling on how the quarter is likely to pan out for these companies.The positive chart patterns on the Nifty like the higher tops and higher bottoms remain intact, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities, who expects targets of 24,400 on the Nifty in the near-term. 23,980 now becomes a key support for the index on the downside.Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities said that 24,000 now becomes an import support zone for traders, while 24,200 - 24,300 could result in an immediate profit booking zone for the day traders due to the temporary overbought conditions.Angel One's Osho Krishnan also highlights 24,000 as a key support level on the downside and a break below that could ease the temporarily overbought conditions. He sees an immediate hurdle for the index between 24,200 - 24,250 and therefore advises traders to focus on specific stocks for opportunities.It was only HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank that ensured the Nifty Bank managed to recover at least half of Friday's losses as most of the other banking counters on the Nifty, be it SBI, or Axis Bank or IndusInd Bank were on the losing side during Monday's trading session. The index also managed to close above the 52,500 mark.Technically, the Nifty Bank is still trading below its short-term trendline resistance, said Hrishikesh Yadve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. He expects 53,000 - 53,200 zone to remain a barrier for the Nifty Bank and only a sustained move above 53,200 can take the Nifty Bank towards 54,000.Rupak De of LKP Securities said that the Nifty Bank has made a lower top on the hourly time frame, signifying weakening of the bullish trend. The immediate support is now at 52,500 and a decisive fall below that can trigger a correction on the index. 52,800 - 53,000 are the levels to watch out for on the upside.SAMCO Securities' Om Mehra said that the hourly MACD indicator on the Nifty Bank is pointing to a slowdown in the bullish trend. The 20-day moving average is at 51,000. He expects the index to consolidate in a 1,000-point range between 52,200 and 53,200.Nifty 50's July futures added 3% or 4.3 lakh shares in Open Interest on Monday. They are now trading at a premium of 64.3 points from 121.65 points earlier. On the other hand, the Nifty Bank added 2.3% or 56,505 shares in Open Interest on Monday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.21 from 1.2 earlier.India Cements and Indus Towers continue to remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 24,150 to 24,700 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry, while the 24,900 strike has seen shedding in Open Interest.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 23,300 and 24,100 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's expiry, while the 22,500 strike has seen some shedding in Open Interest.",

It is a different feeling to be called \"World Champions.\"What has also acted like a champion through the June series is the Nifty. From slipping below 22,000 on the Lok Sabha Election Results day on June 4, the index has staged a bounce back like no other, eventually ending the series above the mark of 24,000. But the question now is, has the Nifty run its course for the time being?For the entire third week of June and the better part of last week, it was the banks and index heavyweights like Reliance Industries that continued to lead the market higher. But the former has started to see some signs of exhaustion emerge at higher levels.The banking index was a non-participant during the Nifty's upmove on Thursday and led the index lower on Friday, despite support from other constituents like Reliance. And with the index having moved 7,000 points from the lows of June 4, the question to be asked is, will the Nifty Bank now trigger a correction in the Nifty considering the swift run up seen by both the indices over the last 15-20 sessions?Historically, July has been a good series for the Nifty, with gains ranging between 4% and 7% in three out of the last four years. But this series comes with multiple triggers. Global cues of course, are one, but domestic cues are aplenty as well.Earnings season begins by the second week of July but before that, companies will begin announcing their business updates for the quarter, which will give an indication on how the quarter has been for India Inc. The Union Budget and the progress of the monsoon in the country will also be market moving factors in the month of July.Foreign investors were sellers in small quantity on Friday, while domestic institutions were heavy buyers.Technically, the uptrend remains intact but the RSI on the hourly chart is indicating the possibility of a pullback move or a consolidation within an uptrend in the Nifty, said Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com. In case of a pullback, 23,800 or 23,600 will act as supports for the Nifty. The positional support has also shifted higher to 23,400. On the upside, 24,200 and 24,600 will be barriers for the index. He advises a buy-on-dips approach on the index.Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One said that while taking contra-bets and shorting the market is not advised, taking some profits is prudent at higher levels as either a price or time correction can be anticipated. 24,200 - 24,250 is an immediate resistance for the Nifty, while 23,850 and 23,650 on the downside can be key support levels.HDFC Securities' Nagaraj Shetti too sees the Nifty facing hurdles between 24,000 and 24,100, even as the near-term uptrend remains intact. He advises a pullback to be used as a buying opportunity with immediate support at levels of 23,800.The Nifty Bank has gained for seven weeks in a row. It may also be due to this, that some bit of exhaustion is beginning to creep in at higher levels for the index. The Nifty Bank fell nearly 500 points on Friday, and struggled to close above 53,000 yet again. Friday's high was lower than the one it made on Thursday. Yet, the index was up 1.3% for the week.Kunal Shah of LKP Securities also termed Friday's move as the first meaningful correction after a non-stop rally for the Nifty Bank. He said that there needs to be some follow-on selling for the index to fall further, else it may get stuck in a consolidation range. Immediate support is at 52,000, while 52,700 - 53,000 is a barrier for the index.The Nifty Bank chart displays an evening star pattern, which is bearish and the daily RSI at 65 is shifting down towards its average line, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. The resistance for the index remains near 52,900 - 53,050 range, while the support is at 51,700. He advises a \"sell-on-rise\" strategy on the index, till it decisively moves above 53,000.Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates' Hrishikesh Yedve also believes that the Nifty Bank has formed a bearish candle near the trendline resistance and for the short-term 53,200 will act as a hurdle. Only on sustaining above 53,200, can the index see a rally towards 54,000.Nifty 50's July futures added 1.7% or 2.3 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday. They are trading at a premium of 121.65 points. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's July futures added 0.8% or 19,350 shares in Open Interest on Friday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 1.2 from 1.49 earlier.India Cements and Indus Towers have entered the F&O ban.For this Thursday's weekly options expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes between 24,200 and 25,000 have seen Open Interest addition.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 23,500 and 24,150 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.",

No level has proven to be a resistance for the index. The Nifty on Thursday just posted its best F&O series since December last year.The Nifty had made a low of 23,350 on Monday , which is when 23,500 was still a significant barrier for the index. By Thursday, the Nifty has closed above 24,000. Even the biggest bull on the index could not have thought that for an index that slipped below even the 22,000 mark on the Lok Sabha election result day, has recovered nearly 3,000 points from those levels.On Thursday, the Nifty had at least three intraday dips when it fell towards the lowest point of the day. Every single dip was convincingly bought into. The fact that the index closed above 24,000 and near the day's high will give the bulls even more confidence. In fact, after that 6% drop on June 4, the Nifty has declined only thrice, with the biggest single-day decline being 0.3% on June 21.The Nifty is up 2.3% for the week and is on course to register its second-best week of 2024. In fact, another 1.5% move higher on Friday and the index may just have its best week of the year, only three weeks after the first one. The market on Friday may also react to some key takeaways from the SEBI board meet, where some decisions were taken with regards to F&O entry of stocks and delisting as well.For Thursday's trading session, foreign institutions were net buyers in the cash market, while domestic institutions were net sellers.The Nifty has seen building of long positions and with a surge in rollover activities, the bullish momentum can continue in the July series as well, said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal. Till the Nifty holds above 23,750, it can now move further higher towards 24,250 and 24,500. Downside supports are between 23,750 and 23,500.Apurva Sheth of SAMCO Securities said that with the bulls sitting firmly in the driving seat and multiple factors like liquidity, seasonality and momentum in favour of the bulls, the rally on the Nifty may continue in July and the index can see levels of 24,500 on the upside.Angel One's Rajesh Bhosale is of the view that this rapid surge on the Nifty has pushed oscillators across major timeframes into overbought territory. While he does not advise shorting the index, he says it is prudent to take some profits as a time-wise or a price correction can be expected in the near-term, which should be healthy for the ongoing bull run. 23,850 and 23,650 are key levels on the downside.Thursday's move on the Nifty came despite the underperformance of the Nifty Bank, which has been pulling the index higher for a better part of this week and the last. The index briefly crossed the 53,000 mark intraday but could not sustain above those levels, closing nearly 400 points off the highs of the day as some profit booking was witnessed at higher levels. For the week, the Nifty Bank is up 2.2% and is poised for its seventh straight weekly advance.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities said that the Nifty Bank will face some resistance at the mark of 53,300 on the upside. With a bearish candle on the daily chart, he expects the index to consolidate with subdued momentum. The support on the downside is at 52,200 but a break above 53,080 can take the index to 53,400 - 53,500.The Nifty Bank has formed the bearish candle near the 53,000 - 53,200 zone, which will act as a resistance, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. The rally on the Nifty bank can extend to 54,000 only if it sustains above the 53,200 mark.",

If a sector leading the Nifty on one day underperforms on the next, another sector puts its hand up and leads the charge. When the largecaps sulked, the broader markets made merry. For the last few days, the broader markets have been listless, and the largecaps have put their hand up and how.Banks turned up in large numbers to lead the Nifty higher on Tuesday. They turned up on Wednesday too but not as ferociously as Tuesday. That job in mid-week trading was taken care off by Reliance Industries. Two-thirds of the Nifty's gains or 92 out of 145 points came from Reliance Industries, the second biggest constituent on the Nifty by weightage.Reliance Industries also ended at a record high on Wednesday, with a market capitalisation of \u20b920.5 lakh crore. Is there more steam left in the stock? You can read the answer here. The last few trading sessions have all been about largecap stocks, whether it be banks, or Reliance Industries, or Bharti Airtel and even L&T. This largecap rally has put the broader markets on the back burner, something that has not happened often in the last 18 months or so.Both Nifty Midcap and Nifty Smallcap indices continued to struggle for momentum on Wednesday as well. Real estate sold-off for the second day running, as did Metal stocks. Profit booking was also witnessed in the auto stocks. But cement as a sector stood out with most stocks witnessing gains between 2% to 4%. India Cements though emerged as the outperformer, ending 14% higher. More on that here. Thursday will be the monthly expiry for the June F&O series for the Nifty 50 contracts. Until the final day, the Nifty has gained 1,400 points so far this series, making it the best F&O series in many years. The April F&O series of 2020 had seen the Nifty gain over 1,200 points. The Nifty is now just 130 points away from the mark of 24,000.Foreign institutions were net sellers in the cash market on Wednesday, while domestic institutions were net buyers. Numbers will also be skewed due to the multiple block deals that took place on Wednesday.As of now, with no signs of trend reversal, traders are advised to continue to trade with a positive bias and trail stop losses higher on existing long positions, said Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com. He also said that support for the Nifty has shifted higher to 23,600, while 23,900 and 24,125 will be the upside barriers on expiry day.Nagaraj Shetti called the formation of a long bull candle on the Nifty's daily chart for the third consecutive day as a bullish 'three advancing soldiers' type candle pattern, which indicates continuation of the upside for the near-term. He expects the present upside momentum to find resistance at 24,000 - 24,100 levels and that may result in the next round of consolidation or minor weakness. Immediate support is at 23,650.Kotak Securities' Shrikant Chouhan also expects some profit booking at higher levels due to the temporary overbought setups on the charts. For breakout traders, 23,750 is the key support level, above which the index has the potential to test levels of 24,050. Below those levels, the uptrend may be vulnerable.The Nifty Bank fell 12 points shy of the 53,000 mark on Wednesday, which also happened to be its monthly expiry. The index has now recovered nearly 7,000 points from the lows of June 4. The gains were kept in check as HDFC Bank, after days of outperformance, witnessed some profit booking around levels of \u20b91,700. The index has surged over 7% in the month of June. The index is now 130 points away from the 53,000 mark.The Nifty Bank is currently witnessing a breakout from the rounding bottom pattern above 51,134, which has triggered the strong rally, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. On the upside, 53,000 will act as a strong hurdle and a move above that can see the rally extend towards 54,000.Kunal Shah of LKP Securities said that fresh call writing is visible at the 53,000 mark for the Nifty Bank but the undertone remains bullish and a buy-on-dips approach is advised. Immediate support is at 52,500 - 52,400 for the Nifty Bank.SAMCO Securities' Om Mehra believes that the Nifty Bank may see some consolidation towards the 53,000 mark. However, in case the index does breach the 53,040 level on the upside, the Nifty Bank can move higher towards levels of 53,280 - 53,350.Nifty 50's futures across series added 3.7% in Open Interest on Wednesday. Current rollovers ahead of expiry day are at 61.2%. They are trading at a discount of 0.85 points, compared to a premium of 9.95 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's futures added 8.8% in Open Interest and ended the series with rollovers of 70.7%. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 1.31 from 1.38 earlier.India Cements has entered the F&O ban.GNFC, Indus Towers, PNB, SAIL continue to remain in the F&O ban.For Thursday's monthly expiry, the Nifty 50's Call strikes between 23,900 and 24,100 have seen Open Interest addition.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 23,700 and 23,850 have seen Open Interest addition for Thursday's monthly expiry.",

The index is now up by well over 1,200 points for the June F&O series, with two more trading sessions to go.But if the Nifty made new highs on Tuesday, it owes a profuse amount of gratitude to the Nifty Bank, which has continued with where it left off last week. Four out of the top five gainers on the Nifty 50 index were private financials, including Shriram Finance, the newest entrant on the index.The Nifty gained 183 points on Tuesday. Three-quarters or 75% or 138 of those points, came from three banking heavyweights - HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank. ICICI Bank on Tuesday crossed $100 billion in market capitalisation, becoming the sixth Indian enterprise to do so. HDFC Bank too, has been witnessing its best month of 2024 and that continued, with the stock now turning positive for the year. You can read more on that here. The question to be asked now is, can the Nifty sustain a single-sector-led rally? barring the banks, the rest of the market relatively sulked through the day. Advance-Decline on the Nifty too was at absolute parity with equal advances and declines. The Midcap index ended with losses, real estate saw a sharp sell-off, as did Metals, where the profit booking continued. Of course, the bulls would want to enjoy this run till it lasts.With banks witnessing intense selling pressure from FIIs through most parts of the year, there is still some buying interest within the FII community as most foreign brokerages continue to find value in largecap private financials. From the June 4 lows of 46,077, the Nifty Bank has recovered over 6,500 points in just 15 trading sessions, including the one on June 4.Foreign investors were net buyers in Tuesday's trading session while domestic institutions chose to book some profits at higher levels.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities said that the session's opening and lows for the Nifty Bank were almost identical, indicating strong buying interest right from the onset. He said that the primary trend remains firmly upward, suggesting that any pullback towards the 52,400 - 52,500 range will be a buying opportunity.Technically, the Nifty Bank has crossed the short-term trend line resistance and sustained above the mark of 52,000, indicating strength, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. Thus, till it holds above 52,000, he advises using a buy-on-dips strategy. On the upside 53,000 is now the next hurdle for the index.Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com expects some stock specific correction in the broader markets, but believes that the trend for the index remains higher. He expects the Nifty to rally up to 23,900 - 24,000 levels, which is the retracement level of the recent correction. The support base too is shifting higher, and immediate support is now at 23,550, followed by positional support at 23,350.The market is now showing signs of an upside breakout in the near-term, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. The next upside levels to be watched out for are around 24,000. Immediate support is now at 23,550.LKP Securities' Rupak De said that the Nifty will remain strong in the short-term till it sustains above the 23,500 mark and move higher towards the 24,000 level. Put writers, he said, have been very active at the 23,600 and 23,700 strike.Nifty 50's futures across series added 5.4% in Open Interest on Tuesday. Current rollovers are at 45.7%. They are now trading at a premium of 9.95 points compared to 5.35 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's futures across series added 18.7% in Open Interest on Tuesday. Current rollovers are at 55.5%. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.38 from 1.14 earlier.Balrampur Chini, Chambal Fertilisers, Granules India, Piramal Enterprises are out of the F&O ban.GNFC, Indus Towers, PNB, SAIL continue to remain in the F&O ban.For Thursday's monthly expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes of 23,750 and 23,850 have seen Open Interest addition, while the 23,500 strike saw Open Interest shedding.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 23,500 and 23,700 have seen Open Interest addition for Thursday's expiry.",

That dip, was swiftly bought into, leading to a 200-point recovery on the index.What will give the bulls further heart is the fact that not only did the Nifty recover from the lows of the day , which came at the midpoint of the 23,400 - 23,300 support zone, but also ended in the positive territory, well above the mark of 23,500.The broader markets though had a mixed day. The Midcap index recovered nearly 700 points from the lows of the day to end with gains, but the Smallcap index, despite the recovery from the lows, could not recover all of its losses.Specific pockets dominated Monday's trade. As swiftly as the fertiliser stocks went up all of last week, they sold off equally swiftly on Monday after no headway was made on the GST rate cut for the sector. On the other hand, holding company stocks sprung into action with most of them ending 20% higher post a SEBI Circular on a special call option for fair price discovery. You can read more on that here. Till the end of the series, barring a specific trigger, the action in the market is most likely to remain confined to specific pockets. The market also looks forward to the presentation of the Union budget, the official date for which is yet to be announced. Before the union budget though, the companies will start reporting their June quarter business updates starting next week, followed by their quarterly results.Immediate support for the Nifty is placed at 23,350 - 23,300, which is the level from where the Nifty recovered on Monday. Till that is intact, the momentum remains positive, said Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com. On the upside, 23,650 - 23,700 is a level for the Nifty, which, if surpassed, could take the index towards 23,900 - 24,000.Rajesh Bhosale advises avoiding aggressive bets on the index and focus on playing the range by buying on dips and booking longs at higher levels. Key support remains at 23,350 for the Nifty, followed by the 89-EMA on the hourly chart at 23,300. On the upside, 23,650 - 23,700 is the barrier.For Nifty's day traders, 23,400 will be a key support, according to Kotak Securities' Shrikant Chouhan. Above these levels, the Nifty has the potential to test levels of 23,670 or even 23,750. On the downside, a slip below 23,400 can accelerate the selling towards 23,320 or even 23,275 levels.The Nifty Bank, the star of last week also witnessed a buy-on-dips pattern. That was not the only positive from Monday's session. It also managed to hold on to its earlier record high of 51,133 on the downside, reversing from levels of 51,138 and recovering nearly 600 points from the lows. The index is now just 250 points away from its recent high of 51,957.The Nifty Bank has retested the recent breakout point which indicates strength, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. He advises continuing with the buy on dips strategy till the index holds the 51,000 mark. On the higher side, 52,000 will continue to act as a barrier.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities said that the daily MACD and RSI indicators remain positive, indicating ongoing bullish strength. Only a break above levels of 52,000 will take the index towards the 52,440 - 52,500 range.Nifty 50's futures across series added 1.8% in Open Interest on Monday. Current rollovers are now at 34.5%. The futures are now trading at a premium of 5.35 points from a discount of 13.8 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's futures across series added 1% in Open Interest on Monday. Current rollovers for them are at 38.2%. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.14 from 1.04 earlier.PNB and SAIL have entered the F&O Ban.Hindustan Copper and Hindustan Aeronautics are out of the F&O ban.Balrampur Chini, Chambal Fertilisers, GNFC, Granules India, Indus Towers and Piramal Enterprises are still in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 23,400 and 24,000 have seen an addition in Open Interest for this Thursday's monthly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 23,300 and 23,500 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's monthly expiry.",

The Nifty Bank though, was the star of the week gone by and when that came off the highs on Friday, it took the Nifty along with it as well.While the Nifty remains in consolidation mode, the action will lie in specific stocks, as has been the trend in the last few trading sessions. Most of the GST-linked names from fertilisers, to road construction companies to even Delta Corp, may see a reaction during Monday's trading sessions. Block deals also continue with CarTrade Tech likely to see one go through on Monday.Foreign investors returned to be net sellers in the cash market on Friday, while domestic investors were back to being net buyers.Amol Athawale of Kotak Securities expects the Nifty to take a dip towards levels of 23,300 till it trades below the mark of 23,650. In case the index slips below 23,300, it can also see levels of 23,175. Only a break above 23,650 can take the index back to levels of 23,800 or even 24,000.The short-term trend of the Nifty remains rangebound but with a weak bias. A move below the immediate downside support of 23,300 - 23,250 can possibly indicate the start of a short-term downward correction in the market., said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities.Angel One's Osho Krishnan is of the view that the small-bodied candle formations suggest that the bulls may be reaching their limit and could be waiting for an external trigger to continue their momentum. On the upside, he sees 23,650 - 23,700 as potential resistance levels, while 23,400 on the downside can be a key support, followed by 23,200 and 23,100.The Nifty Bank witnessed its best week of 2024, ending with gains of over 3% but signs of exhaustion were visible on Friday at higher levels, when the index came within 60 points of the 52,000 mark, but could not sustain at those levels. It closed nearly 300 points off the highs of the day and with losses.In fact, the index traded in a very wide 700-point range on Friday, falling to lows of 51,200 but recovering from those levels by closing. This was also the sixth straight weekly gain for the Nifty Bank. For the June series so far, the Nifty Bank has gained over 3,000 points.The Nifty Bank has formed a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern, which means that the previous high of 51,935 will now act as a barrier, while the earlier record high of 51,134 will be a support, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. He expects the Nifty Bank to consolidate in the 51,000 - 52,000 range.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities also expects the Nifty Bank to consolidate in the near-term, having formed a bearish candle on its daily charts. 50,600 on the downside is seen as a strong support, while the upper bollinger band resistance is seen at 52,000.Nifty 50's futures across series shed 2.6% in Open Interest on Friday. Current rollovers are at 23.6%. The futures for June are currently trading at a discount of 13.8 points from a premium of 15.5 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's futures across series shed 6.4% in Open Interest on Friday. Current rollovers for the Nifty Bank are at 30%. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 1.04 from 1.3 earlier.Chambal Fertilisers and Granules India are back in the F&O ban.Birlasoft is out of the F&O ban.Balrampur Chini, GNFC, Hindustan Aeronautics, Hindustan Copper, Indus towers and Piramal Enterprises are still in the F&O ban.For this monthly expiry on Thursday, the Nifty 50 Call strikes between 23,500 and 24,000 saw Open Interest addition.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 23,000 and 23,400 saw addition in Open Interest for this monthly expiry.",

This trend may continue till the end of the month, post which companies start reporting their business updates for the quarter followed by their quarterly results. Yes, analysts still believe that this is a buy-on-dips market, but the dips are insignificant, which swiftly get bought into. Something similar happened on Thursday too.The Nifty traded in a 170-point band on its weekly options expiry session. It saw a quick intraday dip towards 23,440 levels in the initial minutes of trade, but recovered faster as well. At one point, the index even crossed 23,600 and came within 40 points of its record high of 23,664, but could not sustain above those levels, eventually ending above the 23,550 mark.Unlike Wednesday, when the Nifty gave up all of its gains to end with losses, it managed to hang on to the gains on Thursday. That was courtesy of the index heavyweights, that lent support and aided the recovery from lower levels. Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank together contributed 62 points to the Nifty upside, while the index itself, ended with gains of 50 points.To read more about the stocks that made headlines on Thursday, click here. For Friday, the market only has global cues to react to and there are plenty of them. The initial jobless claims in the US, the Bank of England interest rate decision, the US crude oil inventory data and of course, how Wall Street behaves overnight.The Nifty is up around 100 points or 0.4% for the week and needs a close above levels of 23,467 to sustain weekly gains, which, if achieved, will be the third straight weekly advance for the index.Foreign institutions were net buyers in the cash market on Thursday, while domestic institutions were net sellersKunal Shah of LKP Securities said the market consolidated within a range, with the index stuck between 23,400 and 23,650. Shah said the undertone remains bullish as long as the index sustains above the 23,400 support, where aggressive put writing is visible.\"Surpassing the 23,650 mark will open further room towards the 23,800/24,000 levels,\" he added.From a technical standpoint, Nifty is likely to consolidate in the near period until some decisive triggers impact the market sentiment, said Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical & Derivatives at Angel One.On the level-specific front, 23450-23400 is projected to offer strong support against any short-term declines, with a reliable support level at 23300-23200. While with the ongoing hesitancy 23650-23700 seems a daunting task for the Bulls in the comparable period, Krishan said.The Nifty Bank, meanwhile, rallied nearly 400 points on Thursday tracking positive global cues. The index jumped 385 points to close at 51,783 while the Nifty50 gained 51 points to close at 23,567.The Nifty Bank continued its strong momentum and managed to hold the support at 51,200-51,000. The bullish momentum is likely to continue, and dips should be utilised to buy the index targeting 52,200/52,600. The lower-end support is placed at 51,000, where the highest open interest is built up on the put side. A break below this level will only dampen the bullish sentiment, said Kunal Shah of LKP Securities.Nifty 50's June futures added 0.3% or 42,775 shares in Open Interest on Thursday.

However, the actual price action of the day is far from quiet. It turned out to be another day and another record for the Nifty but the index could not sustain at those levels. For the record keepers, 23,664 is now the new record high for the Nifty.The index fell 150 points from those levels and ended with losses, snapping a four-day winning streak. The Nifty may have ended only 40 points lower and it owes profuse thanks to the Nifty Bank for keeping its losses in check.The Nifty bank witnessed a 1,000 point rally on the day of its weekly options expiry, scaling not only past its earlier record high of 51,133, which it had hit on June 3, but also nearly touching the mark of 52,000. The index eventually reversed 500 points from its intraday high of 51,957, which now becomes the new record high.Yet, the Nifty Bank managed to register a record closing high. Led by the underperforming HDFC Bank, six out of the top seven Nifty contributors are banking stocks, which also kept a lid on the Nifty downside. In fact, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank together contributed nearly 120 points to the Nifty's gains.The movement in the Nifty bank on Wednesday formed a strong daily bullish candle. The index, surpassing its previous high of 51,133 indicates a possible push towards the 127.8% Fibonacci extension level, which is placed at 52,550, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. He said the Nifty Bank's RSI is at 64, indicating sustained momentum.Kunal Shah of LKP Securities said that the Nifty Bank is likely to continue its strong momentum with support seen between 51,000 - 50,900 on the downside. He said that the index remains in buy mode and one should aggressively buy dips for targets of 52,100 - 52,600 on the upside.Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates' Neeraj Sharma is of the view that the strength in the Nifty Bank will continue as long as it manages to hold on to the 51,000 mark. Above those levels, it could test levels of 51,800 - 52,000 in the short-term.In what has not happened very often in 2024, the Nifty turned out to be the underperformer, having faced resistance at higher levels. Barring banks and IT, all sectoral indices underperformed. Stocks like Reliance Industries, ITC, Bharti Airtel, L&T put pressure in the index, which banks and IT stocks managed to offset to a certain extent.Although the Nifty is at highs, there is no confirmation of any reversal pattern building up on the charts at higher levels, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities, who only sees further weakness in the index if it slips below the 23,300 mark. This setup may be negated if the Nifty moves further higher.23,650 - 23,700 can be an immediate resistance for the Nifty on the upside, said Angel One's Osho Krishnan. He sees support between the 23,400 - 23,200 band. He expects banks to continue aiding the Nifty on the upside.Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities said that a slip below 23,450 would result in a quick intraday correction towards 23,350 - 23,300 levels, while on the flip side, 23,660 will act as a breakout level for the bulls, which can take the Nifty towards 23,800. The intraday market texture is non-directional and hence, Chouhan advices level-based trading for day traders.Both foreign and domestic investors were net buyers in the cash market on Wednesday. The number will also be skewed due to the five large block deals worth nearly \u20b925,000 crore that took place through the day, including those in Indus Towers, Gland Pharma, ZF Commercial and others.Nifty 50's June futures shed 0.3% or 35,050 shares in Open Interest on Wednesday. They are now trading at a discount of 12.4 points compared to a premium of 10.2 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's June futures shed 2.1% or 52,065 shares in Open Interest on Wednesday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.1 from 1.3 earlier.Chambal Fertilisers, Hindustan Aeronautics, Indus Towers have entered the F&O ban today.Sun TV and GNFC are out of the ban.Piramal Enterprises, Balrampur Chini, Hindustan Copper, India Cements and SAIL remain in the ban list.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 23,500 and 23,750 have seen Open Interest addition for today's weekly options expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 23,200 and 23,300 have seen Open Interest addition for today's expiry, while the 23,450 strike has seen shedding in Open Interest.",

The index finally managed to cross and close above the mark of 23,500, something it failed to do through the June series. The Nifty has now gained in eight out of the last nine trading sessions and has recovered nearly 2,300 points from the June 4 low of 21,281.For Tuesday's performance though, the Nifty has the banking stocks to thank. The financials finally put their hand up, in what has been a month of underperformance for the index. Until last Friday's close, the Nifty Bank was up only 2% for the month of June, compared to Nifty's 4% and Midcap and Smallcap indices 7% and 8% surge respectively.Out of the 90 points that the Nifty added on Tuesday, more than half of those or 45.3 points came from the two banking heavyweights - HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank. Stocks like Axis Bank and SBI also contributed to the Nifty upside.The broader markets continued to outperform with the outperformance being led by Smallcap stocks on Tuesday, even as the Midcaps moved in tandem with the benchmark Nifty. Defence as a theme continued to outshine. Paras Defence saw another 20% circuit after another block deal, HAL shares too surged on positive news flow.However, it was the shipbuilders that continued to shine bright. Mazagon Dock, Cochin Shipyard and Garden Reach Shipbuilders have added nearly \u20b91 lakh crore in market capitalisation till date in 2024. You can read more on that here. With the market lacking any directional cue, the focus is more on global cues. Indian equities also moved higher on Tuesday courtesy of a positive handover from Wall Street overnight.However, many analysts on Wall Street are turning cautious on the rally seen by the benchmark indices. In an interaction with CNBC-TV18 on Tuesday, Danielle DiMartino Booth of QI Research said that the equity market rally in the US is on its last leg and that investors there will be forced to look elsewhere for ideas. She also said that investors should look at gold and other options whenever selling pressure begins in the markets.For Tuesday's trading session, both foreign and domestic investors were net buyers in the cash market.A narrow trading range on the Nifty suggests a potential momentum move nearby, traders should wait for a trigger before getting aggressive with index specific trades, said Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One. Immediate support is around the bullish gap of 23,500, with 23,350 being the key support. With the Nifty now in unchartered territory, 23,650 - 23,700 is an immediate hurdle.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said that the short-term trend of the Nifty continues to remain positive with rangebound action. Having sustained above 23,515, he now expects the Nifty to head towards levels of 23,950 in the near term. Immediate support is at 23,450.Technically, the Nifty has broken out of a consolidation range of 23,000 - 23,500, leading to fresh momentum, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. He expects the gains to extend towards levels of 23,700 and 23,800. On the downside, immediate support is at 23,400, followed by 23,200.The Nifty Bank, as we mentioned earlier, finally took leadership on the index and even outperformed the benchmark on Tuesday. It had to close above the mark of 50,000 for a sustained upmove, which it did on Friday and even sustained on Tuesday with further gains. The index continues to remain at the highest level since June 3. Wednesday will also be the weekly options expiry for the Nifty Bank contracts.The Nifty Bank is trading above its short-term moving average, indicating positive momentum. The support is now at 50,000, which is the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level. Immediate resistance is placed at 51,133, which is the record high, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities.Kunal Shah of LKP Securities said that the Nifty Bank has finally broken out of the 50,200 resistance and closed above it. He now expects the bullish momentum to continue towards the mark of 51,000. Strong support on the downside is now seen at 49,700.Nifty 50's June futures added 1.8% or 2.2 lakh shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. They are now trading at a premium of 10.2 points from 1.05 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's June futures added 3.9% or 91,875 shares in Open Interest on Tuesday.

But its a consolidation that is also slowly taking the index higher. The week gone by saw the index gain in four out of the five trading sessions. It first surpassed the resistance at 23,300, followed by 23,400. By closing on Friday, it now stands at the cusp of 23,500, which has been the major resistance for the index since it scaled newer peaks.Yet, the index continues to make higher highs on the charts. 23,441 on Wednesday, 23,481 on Thursday and now 23,490 on Friday, which stands as the new record high for the Nifty. The market will resume trading after the long weekend on Tuesday.The market now looks for directional cues as most major events are out of the way, including the election results, government formation, the RBI policy as well as the Fed rate decision.It is just two more weeks for the April-June quarter to end, post which, companies would begin to release their quarterly business updates and earnings season would begin as well for the June quarter. The month of July would also see the tabling of the first Union Budget of the newly elected government, dates for which are yet to be confirmed. Sources told CNBC-TV18 that the budget presentation may happen on July 22.For now, the action remains stock specific as the Nifty and the Nifty Bank both have important levels to cross before they head for the next leg of their rally on the upside.Both foreign and domestic institutions were net buyers in Friday's trading session in the cash market.23,500 is the initial hurdle for the Nifty, which has been so in the last week. Once this is surpassed, the index can rally towards 23,900 - 24,000, said Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com. He advises any dip towards support levels of 23,300, followed by 23,000 and 22,900 to be used as a buying opportunity.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the index falls below 23,330, it can witness a bout of profit booking. However, a move towards 24,000 is seen only if the Nifty sustains above 23,500. Immediate support is at 23,000, followed by 22,760.The market is currently witnessing a positive consolidation and as long as it remains above 23,200, the positive sentiment will continue, said Amol Athawale of Kotak Securities. He sees a move above 23,500 to take the Nifty towards 23,750 in the short term and the trend can change only on a slip below 23,200.Among the two indices, the Nifty Bank turned out to be an underperformer last week, but managed to close above the mark of 50,000 for the first time after two weeks and only by just two points. The level of 50,000 has been the resistance for the Nifty Bank throughout the June series and chartists too believe that crossing that is imperative for it to move further higher towards its previous record high of 51,133. For the week, the Nifty Bank ended with gains of 0.4%.The Nifty Bank witnessed strong put writing at the 50,000 strike along with the Call writers. The options activity at this strike will provide cues about the upcoming direction of the Nifty Bank, said Ashwin Ramani of SAMCO Securities.Kunal Shah of LKP Securities maintained that the Nifty Bank will have to decisively surpass 50,200 to confirm an upside breakout towards levels of 51,000. The lower end support is between 49,500 - 49,400 and a break below that will open further downside towards 49,000, he added.Nifty 50's June futures added 0.6% or 77,650 shares in Open Interest on Friday.

After closing above 23,300 on Wednesday, hopes were that the index will be boosted by the US Federal Reserve. Those hopes of an impending rate cut by the world's largest central bank did boost fortunes of the Nifty for a brief period in early trading as the index made a new record high of 23,481.At one point, it did feel like the bulls will finally prevail over the 23,500 mark on the Nifty , but expiry-related volatility caught up soon with the market and the index, like most previous instances this week, fell off the day's high. However, the fall from the highs was not as significant as has been the case during the first three sessions of the week.The Nifty has closed right on the cusp of 23,400, marking a second straight close above 23,300. It also closed above the key zone of 23,350 - 23,370. The index is up 0.5% in a week it has scaled new peaks in three out of the four sessions so far.The broader markets though, continued on their merry ways. The Midcap and Smallcap indices gained for the seventh day in a row and have gained between 12% to 15% from the June 4 drop. The Real Estate index continued to be the top performer, rising for the seventh day as well. Sugar stocks like Balrampur, Dhampur and peers also had a sweet day at the office. You can read more on that here.It may not be a surprise that Friday's session turns out to be a quiet one or one full of action, depending on how market participants intend to head into the long weekend. Yes, its been a while but a long weekend has arrived! Sensex, Nifty and the Indian markets will be shut on Monday on account of the Eid holiday.Both foreign and domestic institutions were net sellers in the cash market on Thursday but that number will be skewed due to the block deal that took place in L&T Finance earlier in the day.The Nifty may see a timewise correction, according to 5paisa.com's Ruchit Jain but just to relieve the overbought setups on the lower timeframe charts. Immediate supports are at 23,200 and 23,000 and any dips towards those supports should be used as a buying opportunity. Immediate hurdle is at 23,500, which, if crossed, can take the index to 23,900 or even 24,000.HDFC Securities' Nagaraj Shetti said that the Nifty remains sideways with a positive bias. He refers to previous such sideways movement has resulted in a downward correction from the highs. The Nifty faces resistance between 23,400 and 23,500, with support at 23,280.The Nifty appears to have entered a timewise phase correction and this consolidation may persist, according to Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One. 23,200 - 23,500 appears to be the immediate range, which may extend to 23,600 in the near-term, he added. Bhosale advises a stock specific approach and avoid carrying aggressive bets over the weekend.The Nifty Bank continues to face resistance at the 50,000 mark due to the heavy call writing seen at that strike recently. It has now declined in three out of the four trading sessions this week. The Nifty Bank again reversed over 350 points from Thursday's high of 50,186 to close in the red. For the week, the index is absolutely flat and needs to close above 49,803 for a weekly gain.Rupak De of LKP Securities said that the Nifty Bank faced rejection at the 50,200 level which is a strong resistance point and has formed a bearish candlestick pattern on the charts. It needs a decisive close above 50,200 for the momentum to return. Till then, 49,500 - 50,200 remains the range for the Nifty Bank.The contracting hourly Bollinger band on the Nifty Bank's charts indicates that a larger movement is expected in the upcoming sessions, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. Immediate support is at 49,530, which, if breached, will drag the index down to levels of 49,200 - 49,100.Nifty 50's June futures shed 2.9% or 3.53 lakh shares in Open Interest on Thursday.

It opened higher, made a new high, sustained the highs for most parts of the day, and eventually saw a sell-off in the final minutes of trade.However, unlike the earlier two sessions, the Nifty did manage to end in the green, with modest gains, but gains nonetheless. For the record keepers, 23,441 now becomes the new record high for the index. The index ended 120 points off those levels on Wednesday.While the lower high and lower low that the Nifty made on Tuesday was negated considering Wednesday's move, what will also please the bulls is the fact that the Nifty managed to close above 23,300 , something it failed to do in the last few sessions, despite testing even 23,400 on the upside. Despite making new highs on Wednesday, the Nifty remains confined in that 200 - 250-point range of 23,200 on the downside and 23,400 - 23,450 on the upside.This makes three levels key for the index for Thursday's session - first of course is 23,400, then Monday's high of 23,411 and the recent record high of 23,441. But chartists also believe that 23,350 - 23,390 is a very important zone for the index to surpass and sustain above, for a sustained upmove on the upside.On expected lines, the US Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, but noted \"modest progress\" towards their 2% inflation target. The FOMC also projected one rate cut this year, compared to three at the start of 2024. A dovish enough Fed was enough to spur a rally in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, both of which made new highs overnight. The S&P 500 closed above the mark of 5,400 for the first time.Both foreign and domestic institutions were net buyers in smaller quantities in the cash market on Wednesday.The Nifty RSI has given a negative crossover in the end on the Nifty hourly charts indicating the possibility of some pullback move or consolidation in the next few sessions, said Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com. The immediate supports for the Nifty are at 23,150 and 22,950, while positional support is at 22,800. He advises traders to continue to focus on stock specific activity and maintain a buy on dips approach on the index.Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One said that 23,400 - 23,500 has emerged as a formidable resistance zone for the Nifty and crossing and sustaining above this is crucial for the index to see fresh momentum. For the weekly expiry on Thursday, 23,200 is a pivotal support and a breakout above this range can trigger significant moves on expiry day.As long as the Nifty does not take out the upward sloping resistance line between 23,400 - 23,500 decisively, one cannot rule out the possibility of a downward move on the index, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. Immediate support is at 23,200 and a slip below that can accelerate the selling pressure.The Nifty Bank tried sustaining above the 50,000 mark on its weekly expiry session but failed to do so yet again. But the index did manage to snap a two-day losing streak. Wednesday's high of 50,232 was just 20 points adrift of Monday's high of 50,252. The index needs to close above 50,979 to recover all the losses it made during the Lok Sabha election results day. Till that important 50,000 level is not decisively taken out, the index remains stuck in a range between 49,000 - 50,000.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty Bank has formed a tristar doji candlestick pattern, which indicates that if the index sustains below 49,530 levels, booking profits may be feasible. On the downside, immediate support is at the 21-DEMA of 49,000.The highest Open Interest on the Call side for the Nifty Bank remains at 50,000, which needs to be surpassed convincingly for the index to move to 50,500 - 51,000, said Kunal Shah of LKP Securities. Support on the downside is at 49,400 and a break below that may intensify the sell-off towards levels of 49,000.Nifty 50's June futures added 0.8% or 95,625 shares in Open Interest on Wednesday. They are trading at a premium of 32.15 points compared to a discount of 44.95 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's June futures shed 5.3% or 1.32 lakh shares in Open Interest.

Same has been the case with the Nifty. At the same time last week, the index was reeling from its biggest single-day drop in four years. As of Tuesday's close, it has already made a new record high, having recovered over 2,000 points in a week.But that frenzied upmove has resulted in exhaustion creeping in among the bulls at higher levels. In both the trading sessions so far this week, the Nifty made attempts to sustain at higher levels but failed on both instances. On Monday, the Nifty made a new record high, but ended with losses. On Tuesday, the index made attempts to retest Monday's high, but couldn't do so, eventually closing nearly unchanged.Yet, the Nifty traded in a range of nearly 200 points. That is the range it has been respecting so far this week. Finding support at 23,200 on the downside, but unable to surpass both 23,300 and 23,400 on the upside. What may not please the bulls though is the fact that the Nifty's high on Tuesday was below Monday's high, as was Tuesday's low of 23,208, which was lower than Monday's low of 23,227.The index is witnessing such moves despite the Volatility Index consistently cooling off. The India VIX fell another 10% on Tuesday to levels below 15, which is in-line with what most market participants had anticipated post the completion of a major event.Two sectors that catch the eye. Real estate is one. The Nifty Realty on Tuesday recovered all the losses it made last Tuesday during the Lok Sabha election results. On the other hand, the PSE index also rose for the fifth straight session and has managed to recover half of last Tuesday's losses.Foreign institutions were net sellers in a small quantity on Tuesday, while domestic institutions remained heavy buyers. This number will also be skewed due to the block deals that took place in stocks like Interglobe Aviation, Honasa Consumer and IRB Infra.Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com does not expect a significant price correction on the Nifty as the daily and weekly momentum remains positive. Immediate support on the downside is at 23,050 and 22,930, while resistance on the upside is at 23,500. He advises focusing on stock-specific trades as there are better opportunities there.The Nifty is currently placed at the hurdle of 23,400 - 23,450 with the weekly hanging man and the opening downside gap of June 4 weighing on the index, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities, who anticipates a dip in the market soon. Immediate downside support is at 23,050.Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities expects 23,400 to be a short-term resistance zone for the Nifty, while 23,200 will continue to act as a key support. In case the index crosses and sustains above 23,400, it can move higher towards 23,525, while a slip below 23,200 can drag the index back down to 23,000.In line with the Nifty recovery, the Nifty Bank too staged an intraday recovery, having taken support at the 49,500 mark. The index also came within 30 points of the 50,000 mark but failed to conquer the same, eventually giving up all the gains and ending the session in the red. The Nifty Bank would look to breakout from this 500 point range during Wednesday's session, which will also be the weekly expiry for the index.Kunal Shah of LKP Securities said that the 50,000 strike on the Nifty Bank has the highest Open Interest concentration. In case the index breaks and sustains above 50,000, it can see sharp short covering towards 50,500 or even 51,000 levels. He advises traders to have a buy on dips approach with support at 49,000 levels.The Nifty Bank ended the session forming a bearish candle with a small body, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. Although the index failed to surpass 50,000, it remains above its short-term moving averages. He expects slight weakness below 49,600 for the Nifty Bank, which may lead to a retest of the 49,300 - 49,100 level. However, he said that the primary trend remains strong as long as the index remains above 49,000.Nifty 50's Jue futures added 0.2% or 20,625 shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. They are now trading at a discount of 44.95 points compared to a 12.05 points discount earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's June futures added 0.7% or 17,400 shares in Open Interest. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 1.02 from 0.97 earlier.GMR Airports and Hindustan Copper have entered the F&O ban, joining India Cements, Balrampur Chini, SAIL and Zee Entertainment.For this Thursday's weekly expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes between 23,450 and 24,000 have seen Open Interest addition.

The Nifty resorted back to its common pattern of hitting highs but failing to sustain above those levels.The Nifty did make a new high on Monday , having fallen 20 points short last Friday. The new record of 23,411 is where the index faced resistance and reversed, eventually ending 150 points adrift of those levels, almost near the day's low.Monday's price action almost errs on the side of caution, similar to how the Wall Street behaved on Friday ahead of the Fed interest rate decision later this week. The market, as of Friday, was projecting a 47% probability of the Fed cutting rates by 25 basis points in September, down from the 55% figure last Thursday. Earlier, that figure stood at close to 70%.Caution seems par for the course too, with the Nifty having seen a 2,000 point swing in the week gone by. Technology shares, which were among the top performers on Friday and through the week, witnessed profit booking and were the worst performers on Monday.When it comes to levels, the previous record high of 23,338 still is key as the index has not closed above that. Once that sustains, the Nifty can look to retest levels of 23,411 but those are levels where supply comes in.For Monday's trading session, both foreign and domestic institutions were net buyers in the cash market. Net equity inflows in the month of May stood at a record high of well over \u20b934,000 crore. The number would also be skewed for Monday's session courtesy of the large block deal in Mphasis.Although the broader Nifty trend remains positive, Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com does not rule out a consolidation or a pullback move to cool the overbought setups on the index. However, he advises traders to use such a correction / dip as a buying opportunity. Immediate downside support is at 23,000 - 22,850, while 23,500 and 23,900 will act as barriers on the upside.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said that the chances of a downward correction on the Nifty are high despite the near-term trend being positive. The index is placed at a critical level of 23,300. Support on the downside is at 23,100.Kotak Securities' Shrikant Chouhan is of the belief that the Nifty staying below 23,400 will trigger a slip towards the 23,100 - 23,025 levels as the correction formation may continue. Only a move above 23,400 and sustaining that will take the index to 23,500. He advises contra traders to go long on the Nifty near 23,025 levels with a 30 points stop loss.The Nifty Bank remained absolutely flat on Monday. The index again crossed the mark of 50,000 on Tuesday. The index has closed at nearly the same level as of Friday. Bulls though will take heart from two things; One being that Monday's intraday high of 50,252 is higher than Friday's high. Tuesday will also be the expiry of the Nifty Financial Services.Kunal Shah of LKP Securities said that the Nifty Bank needs to decisively cross 50,000 to move back towards levels of 50,600 - 51,000 levels. Support at the lower end is at 49,000 levels, he added.The Nifty Bank formed a Gravestone Doji on the daily chart, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. However, he maintained that there is potential weakness in store if the index slips below 49,650, which can take the index further down to 49,300 and 49,150 levels. He too says that the uptrend on the Nifty Bank will resume once the index sustain above the mark of 50,000.Nifty 50's June futures shed 6.6% or 8.59 lakh shares in Open Interest on Monday. They are now trading at a discount of 12.05 points compared to a premium of 35 points. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's June futures shed 6.7% or 1.77 lakh shares in Open Interest on Monday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 0.97 from 1.15 earlier.India Cements has entered the F&O ban along with Balrampur Chini, SAIL and Zee Entertainment.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 23,300 to 24,000 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 23,000 to 23,300 have seen addition in Open Interest for this Thursday's weekly expiry.",

Auto, IT and FMCG stocks led the gains for the week.For the upcoming week, with the new cabinet sworn in, all eyes will be on portfolio allocation and whether or not the key ministers of the Modi 2.0 government will continue with their stint in the new term as well. All eyes will also be on the US Federal Reserve as it meets this week to determine the future course of action.While the bond markets are now expecting a rate cut in September, the Fed, now having become notorious for its flip flops, has put the market in a state of caution and not wanting to think too far ahead. The US markets on Friday ended with modest losses.Foreign investors turned out to be net buyers in the cash market on Friday, while domestic institutions chose to book some profits at higher levels. Data from the NSE shows that retail made the most of the market crash on Tuesday and subsequent recovery over the next three days.

You can read more about that here.

He advises buying the dips and selling the rallies.Having seen a swing of nearly 2,000 points, the Nifty may see some consolidation before the next leg of the upmove, said Osho Krishnan of Angel One.

He too advises using the dips as a buying opportunity.

It closed within touching distance of the 50,000 mark on Friday, but remains around 1,300 points away from its record high of 51,133. For the week, the index gained 1.7%, marking its fourth straight weekly advance and continuing with its positive start to the June F&O series, barring Tuesday's drop.Rupak De of LKP Securities said that the Nifty Bank has formed a bullish engulfing pattern on the daily charts, which indicates strong buying interest. 50,500 is now a key resistance for the Nifty Bank, while 49,200 will act as a key support. In case the resistance is surpassed and sustained, there is scope for further upmove, he added.The Nifty Bank has formed a hanging man candlestick pattern on the weekly charts, said Neeraj Sharma of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. 50,000 is the immediate resistance for the Nifty Bank, followed by 51,133, which is the previous record high.

With the exit polls and results now out of the way, the market is set to post gains in a week it saw its biggest single-day drop in four years and investors wealth worth \u20b930 lakh crore is wiped out.Such has been the recovery in the Nifty over the last two sessions that Tuesday's fall now seems a thing of the past, as if the market has completely forgotten about it. But the recovery has been anything but smooth. The weekly expiry for the Nifty turned out to be a choppy one and even if the index ended above the mark of 22,800, it closed trade 90 points off the day's high.This choppiness may persist until more clarity on government formation and who gets which ministry emerges. The fact that this will also be a coalition government, will be enough to keep the uncertainty lingering till a complete picture emerges.For the week, the Nifty is now up 1.3%. It needs a close above levels of 22,957 to erase all of last week's losses and a close above 22,530 to report weekly gains. For now, Thursday's high of 22,910 will become the first important hurdle for the Nifty, followed by 23,000.Friday's session will also be all about the RBI Monetary Policy Committee. While the street anticipates a status quo and no change in stance, the focus will be on whether the MPC revises either of the GDP or the inflation estimates for financial year 2025.During Thursday's trading session, foreign investors continued to remain heavy sellers in the cash market, while domestic investors were net buyers.It remains to be see how the Nifty reacts around its resistance level of 22,900 - 23,000, said Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.co. A move over 23,000 can trigger further momentum on the Nifty, while 22,600 and 22,500 will be an immediate support, followed by positional support - between 22,200 - 22,300. He advises traders to take a sector or a stock specific approach with proper risk management.Osho Krishnan of Angel One said that the 20-Day Simple Moving Average of 22,600 and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of 22,552 will provide the Nifty some support on the downside. 23,000 on the upside remains a key resistance. He advises investors to remain cautious around those levels.\"We have witnessed that meaningful declines were being bought and the major trend of the market remains intact,\" is the word from Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal. He believes that the Nifty has to hold levels of 22,750 for a move towards 22,950 and 23,100 on the upside, while supports are placed lower at 22,650, followed by 22,450.The Nifty Bank had an equally volatile session on Thursday, finding resistance at the 49,600 mark, eventually ending 400 points below the day's high. It managed to defend the 49,000 mark though on a closing basis. The Nifty Bank is just managing to sustain above the levels it closed last Friday and is absolutely flat for the week with a slight positive bias.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty Bank has formed a tiny red candle on the daily scale indicating a pause in the strong upward momentum. The 34-DEMA will act as an immediate support, which is at 48,190, followed by 47,500. On the upside, 50,000 is the first hurdle for the index, followed by 51,000.The Nifty Bank has closed after forming an indecisive candle, indicating market uncertainty, said Rupak De of LKP Securities. Key support of 48,600 on the downside and upside resistance at 49,800 will determine the market direction going forward.Nifty 50's June futures added 4.1% or 5.4 lakh shares in Open Interest on Thursday. They are now trading at a premium of 78.1 points from 22.55 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's June futures shed 7.5% or 2.15 lakh shares in Open Interest.

At one point on Tuesday, it felt as though the Nifty has gone into a free fall, but it has managed to find some support at lower levels, at least for now.The recovery seen by the Nifty on Wednesday has taken the market back to levels above last Friday's close. In fact, it has even turned positive for the week. The market took heart from the fact that Narendra Modi is all set to be prime minister for a historic third time, albeit in a alliance, but with alliance partners like JD (U) and TDP backing the NDA, the government formation looks mostly certain in the coming few days.Yet, the Nifty is 700 points adrift of its peak of 23,338. That may take a while as many brokerages have turned cautious on the market post this election outcome. Emkay went to the extent of cutting its Nifty target to 22,000, exited all PSUs and gave its model portfolio a more defensive colour.Bernstein also believes that the extreme near term may see some selling pressure on the market, but maintained its Nifty target of 23,500 for the end of the year.The gains on Wednesday was led by FMCG, a sector that did not participate in the post-exit poll rally. Autos, Metals, Real Estate were some of the other top contributors. However, PSUs, which had a disastrous session on Tuesday, had a mixed day.While most of the state-run companies saw some semblance of recovery from Tuesday's losses, defence stocks, shipbuilders in particular, continued to have a rough ride. Stocks like Bharat Dynamics, Cochin Shipyard, Garden Reach, all succumbed to selling for the second day in a row. It remains to be seen whether these themes manage to find a floor soon.Thursday will be the first weekly expiry of an already action-packed start to the June F&O series. Besides the political developments taking place, the market also awaits comments from the Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee on Friday on whether they revise their inflation or GDP outlook for the fiscal year after the fourth quarter print. There are currently no talks of a rate cut from the central bank just yet.Foreign investors continued to remain net sellers in the cash market on Wednesday, while domestic investors were net buyers.Shrikant Chouhan recommends 'level-based trading' for day traders as the current market is very volatile. 22,500 - 22,400 will be the key support on the downside, while 22,800 - 22,950 may act as a resistance area. The uptrend would be vulnerable if the Nifty again slips below 22,400.The Nifty moving above the crucial hurdle of Tuesday's long-range bear candle around 22,250 and moving higher, makes the upper part of the candle at 23,200 the next key level to watch, said HDFC Securities' Nagaraj Shetti. He also said that the market will remain volatile for the short-term and sees immediate support at 22,300 levels.Osho Krishnan has similar levels shared by Shrikant Chouhan earlier. He sees 22,500 - 22,400 as a key downside support, followed by 22,200 - 22,100, while on the upside, 22,800 will be a resistance zone for the Nifty, followed by 23,000.The Nifty Bank is also nearly back to last Friday's closing levels of 48,983 and has also recovered nearly half of Tuesday's losses courtesy of Wednesday's recovery. However, the index is still another 2,000-plus points away from Monday's record high of 51,133. Banking stocks will also continue to be in focus ahead of the RBI policy. Most brokerages, who have turned cautious on the Indian market, remain overweight on financials, courtesy of their growth prospects and valuation comfort.Rupak De of LKP Securities said that the Nifty Bank recovered sharply from its 200-DMA and closed above its rising trendline and its 21-Day Exponential Moving Average. He recommends a 'buy-on-dips' strategy with a stop loss of 47,500. The immediate support is at 47,800, with resistance on the upside at 49,500.On the hourly chart of the Nifty Bank, Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities finds support at 47,300, with resistance at 49,650 and 50,050. A pullback towards 48,500 will present a good buying opportunity for short-term traders, he added.Nifty 50's June futures shed 11.3% or 16.5 lakh shares in Open Interest on Wednesday. They are now trading at a premium of 22.55 points from 23.65 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's June futures added 15.5% or 3.8 lakh shares in Open Interest. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 0.75 from 0.73 earlier.Zee Entertainment is the only stock in the F&O ban.For today's weekly options expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes between 22,600 and 23,200 have seen Open Interest addition.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 22,000 and 22,600 have seen an increase in Open Interest for today's weekly expiry.",

The market, that factored in at least 290-300 seats for the BJP on a standalone basis, sold off sharply after the incumbent party failed to cross the 272 mark by itself.The result was the biggest single-day drop in four years. BSE-listed companies lost \u20b930 lakh crore in market capitalisation. PSUs and Adani Group stocks were the biggest contributors to that drop. With Tuesday's fall, the Nifty now trades at a one-year forward multiple of 19 times price-to-earnings, which is lower than its five-year average of 19.2 times.\"Let's not overplay this political uncertainty, because from the looks of it, at least the way it's looking like, is probably we will have a stable government with BJP being a dominant party, and probably some degree of support from the allies. So I still think that as long as we have a stable government, the market should be fine,\" Pankaj Murarka of Renaissance Investment Managers said.\"We have had a big overweight stance on industrials, capital goods, real estate and consumer discretionary. While we have been running a neutral weight on auto and pharma and we have been underweight a little on global cyclicals. However, with this event, we need to reassess as to where the government formation eventually ends up, what are the priorities of the new government, whether they continue with their capex momentum because in last 5 years the government capex budget has gone up 5x. So let us see where the dust settles,\" said Gautam Duggad of Motilal Oswal Financial Services.Vikas Khemani of Carnelian Asset Management said that investors would want to see a bit more clarity on how the setup will emerge and there is no rush.\"Right now we are in a very, very, you know, kind of uncertain situation. It can turn either way, given the way setup is. So rather wait, but I do believe that long term story of India will not change. We will have to just wait and watch in terms of, you might see a little bit of market correction further coming through as a lot of things play out, because people will keep making hypothesis, traders will unwind position as the development happens,\" he said.Sameet Chavan of Angel One said that there is a high probability that the Nifty may even go on to test the 200-DMA at 21,000 soon. He expects any recovery towards 22,200 or 22,500 to be met with selling pressure, while 21,600 - 21,300 may get tested by wild swings. He advises aggressive momentum traders to be light on positions.The short-term trend of the Nifty is volatile with a negative bias, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. The immediate support is at 21,250, and he expects the market to find new direction once the election-led volatility settles down.Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities said that the 50-DMA of 22,400 and 22,500 will be the key resistance for the Nifty, while 21,600 - 21,300 will be an intraday support. He advises caution for the next few sessions due to the ongoing volatility.The Nifty Bank crossed 50,000 on Monday and gave up 4,000 points in Tuesday's trading session. PSU Banks were the worst hit with every constituent of the index declining over 10%.

The Nifty's 733-point advance, surpassed the 708-point surge it had witnessed in April 2020. BSE-listed companies together added \u20b914 lakh crore in market capitalisation on Monday.Almost every sector barring IT participated in the rally on Monday. If the Nifty surged over 700 points, the heavyweights for sure had a major role to play and so they did. Reliance Industries hit a record high with its market capitalisation returning above the \u20b920 lakh crore mark. Both SBI and ICICI Bank also hit record highs and crossed \u20b98 lakh crore in market cap in the process. SBI is now the third most valued bank in the country in market cap terms after HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank.But the day belonged to PSUs, as it was expected to be. The Nifty PSE index ended 8% higher, the PSU bank index also gained a similar quantum. REC, PFC, Power Grid, all witnessed double digit gains. The former two hit record levels, while Power Grid also crossed \u20b93 lakh crore in market cap on Monday. The India VIX, which has been the bone of contention for the bulls through the month of May, declined over 15% on Monday. All eyes are now on the counting day on Tuesday. Brokerage firm Nomura wrote in its note that in both 2014 and 2019, the exit polls had underestimated the NDA-seat count by 50 seats and if trend continues on Tuesday, the final NDA tally may turn out to be even better than what has been projected.Foreign investors were heavy buyers in the cash market on Monday. With FIIs being record net short at the start of the June series, some bit of short covering may have taken place. Additionally, brokerages like Nomura and Jefferies also highlighted the fact that FIIs may return to the market if the NDA government is re-elected.Neeraj Sharma of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that 23,500 - 23,800 will be the first band of resistance for the Nifty. However, the election results on Tuesday may cause some market volatility. On the downside, 23,110 will be a support for the Nifty, followed by the 21-Day Exponential Moving Average at 22,620.The need for caution at higher levels ahead of counting day was also echoed by Angel one's Osho Krishnan, who sees 23,100 - 23,000 to be a support area for the Nifty, while 23,500 on the upside will be a barrier. He advises traders to avoid aggressive bets and keep booking profits.The other star of Monday's session was the Nifty Bank, which eventually crossed the mark of 50,000 and has doubled in the last six-and-a-half years. The surge of nearly 2,000-points on the index was led by HDFC Bank, SBI, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank. The index even crossed the mark of 51,000 before closing a tad below that. The Nifty Bank's 4% surge was the best seen in a single day by the index since 2021.The Nifty Bank has formed a bullish hammer formation on the daily charts, incidating potential bullish momentum, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. The immediate resistance for the index now is at 52,000, followed by 52,500. It also has to sustain above levels of 49,800 to continue this momentum.However, Rupak De of LKP Securities said that strong bullish sentiment surrounding the exit poll results may have driven the rally on the Nifty Bank but advised to observe the market for the next 2-3 sessions before making a correct decision on whether or not to adopt a buy-on-dips strategy.",

They have also been on similar lines as the market had anticipated. Many brokerage houses had projected the BJP to win between 290-310 seats by themselves and then added more by the coalition partners.The Nifty had a forgettable last week as investors chose to book profit from record levels and wait for the exit polls outcome by sitting on the sidelines. The index ended 2% lower in the week gone by. Investors lost over \u20b98 lakh crore courtesy of the weakness seen last week. However, they might look to recover most of that sooner or later, post the exit poll outcome. Counting for the Lok Sabha elections will take place on Tuesday, June 4.Prashant Khemka of White Oak Capital believes that the Nifty will be hitting levels of 50,000 in the next five years, which is more than double of where it currently is. This though, is possible, if earnings growth remains at 15% during this period.Khemka further said that fund managers are sitting on a lot of cash and therefore he expects a large magnitude of FII buying to take place in the coming days.The FII buying in heavy quantity sentiment was also shared by Raamdeo Agrawal of Motilal Oswal Financial Services. He said that if FIIs start buying or not sell, it can change the colour of the market.Foreign investors have been heavy sellers in the cash market through the month of May. Barring a couple of trading sessions where they were buyers, they have remained net sellers to the tune of nearly \u20b930,000 crore through the month. Foreign investors were also record net short on the Nifty at the start of the June F&O series, increasing the possibilities of a short-covering rally.\"The MF players would be the largest beneficiaries of the uptick that could be seen in the next few days in terms of short coverings, the FIIs coming and buying and maybe the participation could increase significantly from those who have been sitting on the sidelines,\" A Balasubramanian of Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC said.Both foreign and domestic institutions were net buyers in the cash market on Friday. That is also due to the MSCI inflows worth over $2 billion that got adjusted during the closing minutes of Friday's trading session.Among the sectors that brokerages have bet on that are likely to be the key beneficiaries on the continuation of the current government would be PSUs, railways, defence, and other manufacturing and capex oriented sectors.Raamdeo Agrawal of Motilal Oswal though, expects the banks to emerge as the outperformers. CLSA also prefers larger banks due to the valuation comfort.\"As an investor I am going to be looking at the portfolio tomorrow and day after but not buying into anything specifically. If you had to buy anything, there are pockets like PSU banks,\" Prakash Diwan, market expert said.Nifty 50's June futures added 8.2% or 11.2 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday.

The index has already corrected nearly 700 points from Monday's record high of 23,110. This five day losing streak has been the longest for the Nifty in the last seven months.At one point on Thursday, which was the monthly expiry for the Nifty , the index was on the verge of breaking the 22,400 mark but manage to salvage some recovery from the day's low of 22,417. Nine Nifty constituents contributed to more than half of the losses on the index on Thursday, led by Reliance Industries, Tata Steel, ITC, TCS.On the charts, the Nifty has now been making lower highs, and lower lows for the last four trading sessions. Thursday's low of 22,417 was also the lowest seen by the Nifty since May 21.The market, which had some solace from the banks and broader markets in the initial parts of the week, also faced pressure from the broader markets. The Midcap and Smallcap index both fell over 1.5%. Metals and IT were the biggest sectoral losers. The Nifty IT fell for the third day in a row.After Thursday's close, the Nifty is down to the lowest level in two weeks. The index is now down 1.7% for the week and is set to snap a two-week gaining streak.For Thursday's trading session, foreign institutions remained net sellers while domestic institutions were buyers in the cash market. The figures would also be influenced by block deals in KFin Tech, RR Kabel and IRB Infra.Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities believes that the market has completed one leg of the correction and the 20-Day Moving Average around 22,450 will be a trend decider for the Nifty. Above that, the Nifty can move back to 22,750, but a fall below 22,450 can lead to a further correction to 22,325. He advises short-term traders to exercise caution and be selective as there is a risk to get trapped at lower levels.The short-term sentiment for the Nifty remains weak, as per LKP Securities' Rupak De, as the index has slipped below its 21-Day Exponential Moving Average. The Nifty needs to sustain above 22,500 to see a meaningful recovery, said De. A failure to move above 22,500 can attract further selling pressure towards 22,300 or maybe even 22,100.Subash Gangadharan of HDFC Securities is expecting the Nifty to see a bounce in the coming sessions but the bulls will have to ensure a close above 22,706 for the Nifty to regain control. Supports to watch in case weakness resumes are 22,417, which is Thursday's low and 22,387.On a day when all sectoral indices took a beating, it was the Nifty Bank that stood tall. The index was the only one along with the Nifty Media index that ended with gains. On an intraday basis, the index also briefly crossed the mark of 49,000 but could not sustain above that. HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, stocks which led the downside on Wednesday, turned out to be outperformers on the monthly expiry day.Even on a weekly basis, the Nifty Bank has been an outperformer and is down only 0.3% so far.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities said that the Nifty Bank filled a gap from the previous session at 49,000 but could not sustain above it. Immediate support for the Nifty Bank is at 48,300, followed by 48,000. On the upside, 49,000 and 49,100 will continue as a barrier.The Nifty Bank defended its 21-DEMA and found resistance near the mark of 49,000 and 49,050, said Neeraj Sharma of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. Only a move above 40,050 can first take the index to the recent high of 49,690 and then towards 50,000.Nifty 50 ended the May series with rollovers of 72%.Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail, Hindustan Copper, Vodafone Idea and GMR Airports are all out of the F&O ban.Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio at 1.11 from 0.79.For next Thursday's weekly expiry, which will be the first of the June series, the Nifty 50 strikes between 22,500 and 23,000 have seen Open Interest addition.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 22,400 and 22,600 saw Open Interest addition for next Thursday's weekly expiry.",

The last four days of losses have made the Nifty bulls jittery and almost taken the index on the brink of turning negative for the series. The Nifty is now down 400 points from Monday's high of 23,110.Of course, that comes with a 1,200 point surge from the May 14 lows as well, but there have been no signs of the dip getting bought into in either of the three sessions this week. Yet again, the Nifty ended pretty much at the lowest point of the day on Wednesday You may want to think whether this is pre-positioning before the all important Lok Sabha election results outcome on June 4 or maybe traders just keeping positions light before going for the jugular on election result day.But what may prevent one from thinking of the volatility during the last four days as pre-positioning, is the fact that a lot of the government oriented sectors continue to do well, Defence in particular. That was evident from the post-earnings reaction in both Mazagon Dock and Cochin Shipyard.Brokerages have also mostly factored in a BJP victory on June 4. Nomura's investor survey showed 99.3% of the respondents expecting the incumbent government to be voted back to power. CLSA too has highlighted a list of 54 \"Modi stocks\" that may benefit from the continuation of the current government. For the series, the Nifty is still up by 130 points. Wednesday's low was also the lowest in five trading sessions for the Nifty, while it has been making lower highs on the charts for the last two trading sessions. The VIX may have not moved much on Wednesday, but remained at the mark of 24.Stocks like Tata Steel, Bata, Cummins India, SJVN, NOCIL and HOEC will react to their earnings that were reported after market hours on Wednesday. On what could be the final day of this earnings season, stocks like Apollo Hospitals, Gateway Distriparks, Marksans Pharma, Muthoot Finance will be some of the stocks reporting results.Foreign institutions were back to being net sellers in the cash market on Wednesday, which may also be influenced by the block deal seen in PNB Housing finance. On the other hand, domestic institutions continued to remain net buyers.Rupak De of LKP Securities said that heavy call writing is being seen at the 23,000 and 22,800 strikes of the Nifty, while put writing is seen at 22,800 and 22,700. He expects the Nifty expiry to take place around levels of 22,800. On the flip side, a slip below 22,700 may trigger further selling in the market.22,800 remains a trend decider level for the Nifty, said Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities. He expects the index to slip to levels of 22,600 till it remains below the 22,800 mark. Only a sustained move above 22,800 can change the sentiment and see a bounce towards 22,900 and 22,950.The Nifty has breached the neckline of the recent breakout and is now heading towards the mean of the rising channel, which is placed at 22,600, followed by the 20-Day exponential moving average at 22,500, according to Osho Krishnan of Angel One. The bearish gap of 22,825 - 22,860 is an immediate hurdle for the Nifty, with a bigger resistance at 23,000.The Nifty Bank, which outperformed and stood tall over the last few trading sessions emerged as the biggest underperformer on Wednesday. With heavyweights like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank underperforming, there was no way the index could have managed to hold on to the 49,000 mark, something it did even when the Nifty struggled earlier this week. The index is already down 1,100 points from Monday's high of 49,688.Hrishikesh Yedve sees support for the Nifty Bank at 48,000 levels as it has now confirmed a shooting star pattern on the charts and is sustaining below levels of 49,051. On the upside, 49,600, and 50,000 continue to remain strong barriers, while Wednesday's high of 48,989 could be the first level to cross for the index.The Nifty Bank is hovering around its 20-DMA and and a fall below 48,380 levels can push the index further down to 48,000, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. Resistance on the upside is at 49,000. A double top formation is seen on the Nifty Bank's daily chart, which generally indicates reversal of the bullish trend.Nifty 50's futures across series shed 1.6% in Open Interest on Wednesday. Current rollovers are at 58.7%. The futures are now trading at a premium of 39.1 points from 49.1 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's futures across series added 19.8% in Open Interest on Wednesday. Current rollovers for them are at 67.7%. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 0.79 from 0.94 earlier.GMR Airports has entered the F&O ban on expiry day.Biocon and Piramal Enterprises are out of the ban.Aditya Birla Fashion, Hindustan Copper and Vodafone Idea remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 22,750 and 23,000 have seen an addition in Open Interest for this Thursday's expiry.On the Put side, while strikes between 22,400 and 22,750 have seen Open Interest addition, those of 23,000 and 22,900 have seen Open Interest shedding for this Thursday's expiry.",

The market does not want to get too ahead of the curve before both June 1 and June 4. The exit polls may just be a prelude to what can be expected on June 4 during the Lok Sabha election results. The Nifty, which confidently strolled past 23,000 and even 23,100, couldn't scale past 23,000 on Tuesday.This has been a trend in the week so far. A relatively quiet session and then a sell-off emerges from higher levels in the final 60-90 minutes of the trading session. While the Nifty cooled off 200 points from the highs on Monday, it was a 110-point cool-off on Tuesday. It closed below the mark of 22,900 and at the day's low, something that will not please the bulls yet again.Another factor that may not please the bulls is the rising Volatility Index. The VIX added another 4% on Tuesday to close above the mark of 24.For the market on Monday, there was some comfort that the banks, the broader markets did well, even if the Nifty struggled. But on Tuesday, they too joined the selling bandwagon as the Midcaps underperformed. Every time the broader markets have a bad day, real estate leads the slide downwards, along with PSUs and PSU Banks. That's also because of the run they've had in the last 12 months.Brokerages are estimating the NDA to return to power for the third time on June 4. IIFL Securities does not see a repeat of 2004 happening, JM Financial sees a bull case of 310 seats for the BJP alone, while PhillipCapital is working with a 290-300-seat base case for the BJP.JM Financial advised clients to buy any potential dip and also said that the VIX has topped for this cycle. It also prefers largecaps over the broader market stocks due to the valuation comfort.Wednesday's trading session will see stocks like Aditya Birla Fashion, NBCC, Amara Raja Batteries and others react to their results reported after market hours on Tuesday, while Tata Steel, Alkem Labs, Bata India, Cummins India, IPCA Labs, Samvardhana Motherson, Emami and Mazagon Dock will be reporting results on Wednesday.Foreign and domestic institutions were both net buyers in the cash market on Tuesday. The number may also be skewed due to the multiple block deals seen in stocks like Timken India, PB Fintech, Concord Biotech and others.The Nifty is showing nervousness at higher levels and the India VIX also crossing 24 may result in some profit booking, said Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com. He added that the overall trend is positive as FIIs have covered shorts and the index remains above key moving averages. 23,100 remains a hurdle for the Nifty and crossing that can take the index to 23,400.Subash Gangadharan of HDFC Securities said that it is important for the Nifty to hold its previous swing high of 22,795 for the uptrend to continue. He advises caution in the near-term till the Nifty closes above its immediate resistance of 22,999.Currently, the market texture is non-directional, and that's the view from Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities. 22,800 - 22,750 on the downside is a key support for the Nifty, while 23,000 - 23,100 remains a key hurdle. He advises buying the dips but selling on rallies as well. The sentiment may change only if the Nifty slips below 22,750.The Nifty Bank also fell prey to some selling pressure but the index has remained resilient despite the jitters on the Nifty. Despite the 150-point correction on Tuesday, it has managed to hold on to the 49,000 mark yet again. It also managed to recover 100 points from the lows of the day. The index is up nearly 700 points so far this series.However, Neeraj Sharma of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates sees further weakness on the Nifty Bank as it has formed a dark cloud cover followed by a shooting star candle. Even as the trend is up, the Nifty Bank may see resistance at 49,690 and 50,000. A slip below 49,051 can extend the weakness.SAMCO Securities' Om Mehra agrees with that assessment and that the shooting star on the Nifty Bank's daily chart suggests resistance at higher levels. A break below 49,100 can drag the index down to 48,800. For the uptrend to resume, he wants the index to break and sustain above levels of 49,400.Nifty 50's futures across series added 0.7% in Open Interest on Tuesday. Current rollovers ahead of the penultimate day before expiry are at 49.2%. They are currently trading at a premium of 49.1 from 49.05 earlier.

The index did find resistance at those levels after making a new intraday record of 23,110. However, contrary to the norm, instead of settling at or close to record highs, the Nifty fell nearly 200 points from the day's high in the final 90 minutes of the trading session.The fact that the Nifty closed near the day's low may not please the bulls. With the countdown having begun to the counting of the Lok Sabha election results, the street is awaiting with bated breath for the outcome. While it is common belief that the present dispensation will continue at the center, the question the street wants an answer to is \"by how much?\"According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services' Chairman and market veteran Raamdeo Agrawal, the market expects the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to win at least 310 seats this election. You can read more on that here.While the sell-off in the last hour-and-a-half could be attributed to the pre-election result jitters, the flip side could also be some profit booking from higher levels as the Nifty has recovered nearly 1,300 points from the May 14 low of 21,821. Will that continue till the results are declared on June 4? Time will tell.But as CNBC Awaaz Managing Editor Anuj Singhal highlighted on Monday morning, this week will all be about pre-positioning before the election outcome.Stocks like LIC, NALCO, NMDC, Jubilant Industries, Vishnu Prakash R Punglia, Wockhardt among others will be reacting to their results reported after market hours on Monday.Amara Raja Batteries, Aster DM Healthcare, Balmer Lawrie, Brigade Enterprises, IRCTC, Linde India, Prestige Estates are some stocks that will be reporting their March quarter results on Tuesday.Institutional flows remained on the buy side on Monday with the domestic institutions outbuying the selling that came from overseas investors.The Nifty is trading in a rising channel and reversed from the upper band of that channel on Monday, said Osho Krishnan of Angel One. That upper end of the channel, placed between 23,150 and 23,200 will act as a barrier for the Nifty, showcasing some exhaustion from the bulls. On the downside, the neckline of the breakout around 22,800 - 22,750 will be a support for the Nifty.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty has formed a dark cloud cover after witnessing profit booking from 23,110. Therefore, 23,110 - 23,200 will be a short-term resistance for the index, while 22,800 on the downside will be a support.HDFC Securities' Subash Gangadharan said that the Nifty remains in a firm uptrend and Monday's profit booking is just a breather after the recent recovery. Although he sees new highs in the upcoming sessions for the Nifty, the moves could be volatile. 22,908 - 22,871 can be an immediate support level.The index that has stood tall over the last three trading sessions is the Nifty Bank. While the index also saw some bit of reversal from the day's high around 49,600 on Monday, it ended with substantial gains and also managed to hold the mark of 49,000. HDFC Bank has been the key contributor to this move and also ensured that the Nifty downside is kept in check. From the May 22 low of 47,435, the index has gained nearly 1,800 points as of Monday's close.49,600 becomes the new resistance level for the Nifty Bank, said Rupak De of LKP Securities. Significant put writing is seen at 49,000, which makes it a support. A close above 49,600 can drive the Nifty Bank past 50,000. He advises a buy-on-dips strategy with a 48,900 stop loss as the overall sentiment remains bullish.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities said that the overall sentiment remains strong, support is at 49,000 on the downside, followed by 48,800. \"The index would show signs of weakness only if it falls below 48,600,\" he said. Until then, he too advises using short-term pullbacks as buying opportunities.Nifty 50's futures across series shed 2.4% in Open Interest on Monday. Current rollovers are at 39.9%.

Unlike previous instance, the market did not have to wait for weeks or months for it to arrive after it came within 7 points of that mark on Thursday itself.In just nine sessions, the Nifty recovered 1,200 points from its May 13 low of 21,821. Only par for the course, that this rally had to take a pause after hitting a landmark. The Nifty could not sustain above 23,000 on Friday, ending over 70 points off the intraday record high of 23,026. Yet, the index managed to end 2.2% higher for the week, notching its fourth straight weekly gain in the last five.Largecaps have led the Nifty upmove in the last week. Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank were among the top contributors to the Nifty upmove. Nine out of the top 10 companies in India by market capitalisation added \u20b91.9 lakh crore to their market value last week.The upcoming week will also be the monthly F&O expiry for the Nifty and the Nifty Bank. The Nifty is up over 400 points so far in this series, and a positive end would mean the fourth consecutive positive F&O series for the Nifty.Earnings season also concludes next week with many PSU names like LIC, NMDC, IRCTC, among others reporting results.Monday's trading session will see stocks like United Spirits, NTPC, Hindustan Copper, Sun TV, Allcargo Logistics, Gokaldas Exports among others react to results that were reported after market hours on Friday and over the weekend.Stocks like DCM Shriram, Electronics Mart, GMDC, Natco Pharma, Vishnu Prakash R Punglia will be reporting their results on Monday.Foreign institutions continued to remain net sellers in the cash market on Friday, and have pulled out over \u20b922,000 crore this month, while domestic institutions continued to remain net buyers.The overall trend of the Nifty continues to be positive as there is no sign of a reversal yet. The higher end of the channel indicates resistance for the Nifty in the range of 23,050 - 23,150, said Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com. On crossing these levels, he sees levels of 23,400 - 23,500 on the Nifty. Immediate support is at 22,700, followed by 22,500. He advises buying on any decline.Amol Athawale of Kotak Securities said that the breakout formation on the daily charts supports further upside on the Nifty from current levels. However, he sees rangebound activity due to temporary overbought conditions in the near future. 22,800 - 22,700 on the downside will be the key suport, while 23,150 - 23,250 will be a hurdle.Nifty is likely to remain sideways or rangebound in the near-term with heavy call and put writing around the 23,000 mark, said Rupak De of LKP Securities. Only a fall below 22,950 may drag the index towards 22,800, while a meaningful move above 23,050, will result in a sustained rally.While the Nifty scaled new peaks last week, the Nifty Bank is still 1,000 points away from its record high. The index though, reclaimed the mark of 49,000 for the first time after May 7, although it could not close above those levels. Yet, the banking index outperformed the Nifty on Friday and ended with gains of 1.8% for the week.The Nifty Bank has closed above the 48,260 resistance mark and sustained above it, indicating strength, said Neeraj Sharma of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. He expects the Nifty Bank to test levels of 49,500, till the time it holds 48,000. He advises a buy-on-dips approach on the index.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities said that the immediate support for the Nifty Bank remains at 48,600, followed by 48,500. On the upside, only a sustained move above Friday's high of 49,050, would likely lead to levels of around 49,400 - 49,500.Nifty's futures added 4% across series on Friday. Current rollovers at the start of the expiry week are at 38%. They are currently trading at a premium of 62.5 points compared to 35.05 points earlier. On the other hand, the Nifty Bank futures across series added 4.1% in Open Interest on Friday. Current rollovers are at 29.2%.Biocon, GNFC, Vodafone Idea are back in the F&O Ban.Aditya Birla Capital, Balrampur Chini, Zee Entertainment, IEX, and Metropolis are out of the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 23,000 and 23,300 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's monthly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 22,500 and 23,100 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's monthly expiry.",

The Nifty coming close to a landmark and reversing before hitting that landmark is one such. Thursday's weekly expiry saw the Nifty come within 7 points of the 23,000 mark, but failed to get past that level, eventually closing 33 points adrift of the same. Nonetheless, it was a day to remember for the bulls after a prolonged period of volatile consolidation.The Nifty closed at a record high on Thursday. 22,600 was the first barrier for the index, which it convincingly crossed, followed the previous record high and then 22,800. The second half was one-way traffic for the bulls and the 1.6% surge on Thursday was the best the Nifty has seen in a single day since January 29 this year.What will give the bulls further comfort is the fact that the underperforming banks finally put their hand up, taking the Nifty Bank out of its broad range as well. Three out of the top five point contributors on the Nifty 50 on Thursday were banking majors. Reliance Industries, the other index heavyweight also pushed the Nifty higher along with Larsen & Toubro.In case the Nifty does manage to cross the 23,000 mark on Friday, it would have taken 64 trading sessions for the 1,000 point journey between 22,000 and 23,000. Thursday's surge and the sixth straight day of gains has ensured that the Nifty is up 2.2% for the week so far and is also poised for its best week in four months.On a day when the benchmark indices surged and surged more, the broader markets, both the Midcap and the Smallcap indices were underperformers. Yet, the combined market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies grew by \u20b94 lakh crore on Thursday.The market may have made new records but the VIX has not cooled off in equal proportion. Although the index ended 0.4% lower on Thursday, it remains above the mark of 21 and analysts suggest that it will continue to remain at elevated levels till the results for the Lok Sabha Elections are declared on June 4.Friday's trading session will see stocks like Bikaji, JK Lakshmi Cement, Zaggle Prepaid among others react to their results. Stocks like ITC and Page Industries reported their earnings during market hours on Thursday.Hindalco, Bosch, Torrent Pharma, United Spirits, Ashok Leyland, Glenmark Pharma, Manappuram, Karnataka Bank, Bharat Dynamics among others will be reporting results on Friday.On a day when the Nifty made new records, foreign institutions were heavy buyers in the cash market, as were the domestic investors. The numbers though, may be skewed due to the block deal in Star Health Insurance.The Nifty has made a fresh swing high and witnessed a fresh breakout on the daily charts. The RSI above 60 is likely to keep the momentum intact, said Gaurav Bissa of InCred Equities. \"A close above 22,800 will pave the way for 23,500 levels on the Nifty,\" he added.Subhash Gangadharan of HDFC Securities said the Nifty will make new highs in the coming sessions but the possibility of a short-term consolidation also remains open. On the downside, 22,795 - 22,630 are key support levels to watch.For the breakout traders of the Nifty, 22,800 will be a key support level, according to Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities. Above that level, he expects the Nifty to head to levels of 23,150 - 23,250. A long bullish candle on the daily chart coupled with a breakout formation are suggesting further upside from current levels.Nifty Bank, which has been the underperformer ever since it started correcting from close to levels of 50,000 turned out to be the second best sectoral gainer on Thursday after the Auto index. The index, that struggled to sustain above 48,000 managed to cross that, cross 48,500 and even make an intraday high above 48,800. The 50-DMA support came good for the Nifty Bank as it reversed from those levels. With Thursday's move, the index has also turned positive for this truncated week and is looks set for its fourth weekly gain in the last five weeks.Rupak De of LKP Securities said that the Nifty Bank could rally further towards levels of 49,500, provided that the downside support of 48,500 is intact. The index is still 1,200 points away from its earlier record high of 49,974. Immediate resistance on the upside is at 49,000.A buy-on-dips approach should be adopted in the Nifty Bank, according to Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates. As long as the 48,000 level is held on the downside, the index can move to 49,000 or even 49,500, he added.Nifty 50's May futures added 5.2% and 5 lakh shares in Open Interest on Thursday. They are now trading at a premium of 35.05 points from 60.15 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's May futures shed 3.4% or 76,365 shares in Open Interest. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.37 from 1.2 earlier.Vodafone Idea and Biocon are out of the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 23,000 and 23,500 have seen Open Interest addition for next Thursday's monthly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 22,700 and 23,000 have seen Open Interest addition for next week's monthly expiry.",

It is now at the make or break level of 22,600, sustaining above which will open the doors for the index to make newer highs. Although the index has not seen significant moves in the last five sessions, it continues to edge higher and has been making higher highs on the daily charts for the last seven trading sessions.Thursday will be the weekly options expiry of the Nifty 50 contracts, which will be the penultimate weekly expiry for the May F&O series. The move seen by the Nifty in the last five sessions has ensured that the index has turned positive for the series, only by just, but has turned positive nonetheless.The India VIX also declined on Wednesday, giving some more comfort to the bulls, although that index continues to remain above the mark of 21.The market does remain in a wait and watch mode for the Lok Sabha election results. Even as the Nifty continues to edge higher, there is no significant move on either side on the index.For Thursday's trading session, stocks like Gland Pharma, Jubilant Foodworks, Grasim, Garden Reach Shipbuilders, Power Grid, Metro Brands, Minda Corp among other Nifty and broader market names will react to their quarterly results which were reported after market hours on Wednesday.The Nifty heavyweight ITC reports results on Thursday along with stocks like Barbqeue Nation, Cello World, Finolex Cables, Fortis Healthcare, Honasa Consumer, Schneider Electric, Orchid Pharma, Tega Industries, Steel Strips Wheels, and TD Power.Institutional participation was little on Wednesday with foreign investors continuing to remain net sellers, albeit in a small quantity, while domestic investors outbought the FIIs by an equally smaller quantum.The Nifty is heading towards its previous highs, says Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com. The immediate support base has now shifted higher to 22,430 - 22,370 and till this support is intact, the intraday dip is likely to get bought into. He advises traders to continue with a positive bias on the index.Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One believes that the 22,700 - 22,800 range is crucial for the Nifty and a close above 22,800 will take the index towards 23,000 - 23,100. On the downside, 22,400 is a key support and dips towards that level can be viewed as buying opportunities.22,500 will now be a key support for the trend-following traders, said Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities, above which, the index can move back to 22,700 - 22,735 levels. A slip below 22,500 can result in a quick intraday dip towards 22,400 levels, he added.While the Nifty continues to move higher, the Nifty Bank has been a pain point for the last two trading sessions. CNBC-TV18's Nigel D'Souza had highlighted earlier on Wednesday that the Nifty Bank could test either the 50-DMA on the downside or the 20-DMA on the upside on its weekly expiry session and the former did materialise. The index closed right at the 50-DMA level of 47,777. ICICI Bank, SBI, Axis Bank were the top three underperformers on the index.The fact that the Nifty Bank's open and day's high were the same, indicates short-term weakness for the index, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. The RSI slipping below 50 indicates a neutral to a bearish view. He expects further weakness in case the Nifty Bank slips below 47,600 and a close above 48,100 is needed for the uptrend to resume.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates said that the Nifty Bank closing below its 21-DEMA of 48,040 indicates weakness on the index. The next important level is the 100-DEMA at 47,180 and hence, he expects the index to move in this 1,000-point range of 47,180 to 48,260.Nifty 50's May futures shed 1.2% or 1.2 lakh shares in Open Interest on Wednesday. They are now trading at a premium of 60.15 points from 76.85 points earlier. On the other hand Nifty Bank's May futures shed 6% or 1.4 lakh shares in Open Interest on Wednesday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.2 from 1.15 earlier.Hindustan Copper and Metropolis have entered the F&O ban.GMR Airports and Granules India are out of the F&O ban.Aditya Birla Capital, Balrampur Chini, Bandhan Bank, Biocon, Vodafone Idea, India Cements, Piramal Enterprises, Zee Entertainment, IEX, NALCO and PNB continue to remain in the ban.For today's weekly expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes between 22,600 and 22,750 have seen Open Interest addition, while the 22,500 strike has seen shedding.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 22,500 and 22,650 have seen Open Interest addition for today's weekly expiry.",

The index found support at the lower end of the trading range at 22,400 and resistance at the upper end of the range at 22,600, eventually eking out modest gains to sustain above the 22,500 mark.With Tuesday's session, the Nifty has now gained in seven out of the last eight trading sessions, with four sessions in a row. While the index consolidated after a swift recovery from the May 13 lows, there were plenty of stock-specific opportunities and earnings reactions which gave both the bulls and bears and opportunity.After Tuesday's surge in the broader markets, the Nifty Midcap index crossed the 52,000 mark and the overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies crossed 5 trillion in US Dollar terms. Metal stocks continued on their merry ways as global commodities saw their record breaking run extend for yet another day. The Nifty Metal index is now up for eight straight sessions, during which it has gained 13%. The rise in Silver prices took Hindustan Zinc to new records with the stock having gained more than 130% so far in the first five months of 2024. You can read more on what you should do as a shareholder of Hindustan Zinc here The other sector that stood tall were the railway PSUs with RVNL hitting a record high on Tuesday, while IRFC is nearing its own previous record of \u20b9192.But what next for the Nifty? On crossing 22,300, chartists had projected further upsides towards levels of 22,600, which is now acting as a barrier for the index.For the mid-week trading session on Wednesday, stocks like BHEL, Metropolis, JK Tyre, VA Tech Wabag, Gulf Oil Lubricants will react to their results that were reported after market hours on Tuesday.Wednesday's session will also see Nifty names like Sun Pharma and Grasim report results along with broader market names like Nykaa, Petronet LNG, Jubilant Foodworks, Metro Brands, Gland Pharma, Ramco Cements, Garden Reach Shipbuilders, among other prominent names.Foreign institutions returned to being net sellers in the cash market on Tuesday after a buy figure on Friday. Domestic institutions continued their trend of being buyers.The broader trend for the Nifty remains positive with immediate support between 22,370 and 22,320, said Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com. As this remains a buy-on-dips market, he advises using any dip towards this range as a buying opportunity. The immediate hurdle for the Nifty is seen between 22,600 and 22,650. The VIX, which is now nearing a two-year high, will cool off post election results, said Jain.Subhash Gangadharan of HDFC Securities said that the Nifty holding the 20 and 50-Day Moving Average on the daily chart is a positive signal. The 14-day RSI also is encouraging as it is not in overbought territory. He expects the uptrend to resume once the 22,600 barrier is taken out. Immediate support is at 22,400.With the Nifty approaching the upper end of its consolidation, Rajesh Bhosale of Angel One advises caution and use dips as buying opportunities. He sees support for the Nifty between 22,350 and 22,250, while 22,600 and 22,800 remains a resistance, as has been the case for the last two months.The Nifty Bank snapped a three-day gaining streak on Tuesday, and the moves there may also have been impacted due to the financial services index expiry. Wednesday will be the weekly expiry of the Nifty Bank contracts, the penultimate one of the May F&O series. The positive for the bulls though, would be that despite this 150-point drop on Tuesday, the index remains above the 48,000 mark, which is crucial for further upside.The Nifty Bank has formed an inverted hammer on the daily chart, signalling a potentially bearish signal. The hourly charts, according to SAMCO's Om Mehra, shows that the index can turn slightly bearish on a slip below levels of 47,750. A move above 48,220 though, would signal a return to the bullish trend, he added.Kunal Shah of LKP Securities said that the Nifty Bank failed to surpass the 48,400 mark, where the 20-DMA is placed and only a break above that level will lead to further upside. On the downside, 48,000 is a support where the highest Open Interest on the put side is placed. A move on either side will signal directional moves in the Nifty Bank.Nifty 50's May futures added 0.1% and 4,975 shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. They are currently trading at a premium of 76.85 points from 41.9 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's May futures added 0.3% and 6,645 shares in Open Interest. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.15 from 1.24 earlier.IEX, NALCO, PNB have entered the F&O ban.Hindustan Copper, SAIL and Birlasoft are out of the ban.Aditya Birla Capital, Balrampur Chini, Bandhan Bank, Biocon, GMR Airports, Granules India, Vodafone Idea, India Cements, Piramal Enteprises and Zee Entertainment continue to remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 22,550 and 22,800 have seen Open Interest addition, while 22,300 strike has seen shedding for this Thursday's expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 22,200 and 22,550 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's expiry.",

A common trend across most of these sessions has been a swift and sharp recovery after hitting intraday lows. From the recent swing low of 21,821 on May 13, the index has already recovered nearly 700 points.All of the losses from the week earlier were recovered in this extended week, bringing the Nifty back to where it was at the start of the month. The truncated session on Saturday also saw the Nifty claw back above the mark of 22,500, which is one of the two levels the charts were pointing towards once the index sustained above 22,300.The other positive aspect is that foreign institutions turned net buyers in the cash market during Friday's trading session. This happened for the first time in the month of May. With Saturday being a holiday for foreign institutions, there is no institutional data available.BHEL, NMDC, PI Industries, IRCON, JK Tyre, GSFC, Metropolis, Laxmi Organic, VA Tech Wabag, Gulf Oil are some of the stocks that will be reporting results during Tuesday's trading session.The Nifty's weekly chart has formed a bullish candlestick pattern, indicating more upside for the market, said HDFC Securities' Nagaraj Shetti. The larger range of 22,800 - 21,750 has come into play this week. He now expects the Nifty to move to the upper end of the range at 22,800 in the next 1-2 weeks. Immediate support is at 22,200.Rupak De of LKP Securities said that the small bodied candle on the daily chart suggests very little about the Nifty direction ahead. He also observed heavy writing in both the 22,500 Call and Put. He advises waiting for the first hour of trade before confirming a directional move. Support is visible at 22,400, while 22,600 will be a barrier.The Nifty Bank has now sustained above the level of 48,000 for two days in a row and chartists have been wanting the index to sustain above that level for a potential move towards 48,500 on the upside. The index has gained in five out of the last six trading sessions and managed to recovery half of the 3.1% fall it had in the week prior to last.Amol Athawale of Kotak Securities said that the 50-DMA level of 47,770 on the downside will be the trend deciding level for the Nifty Bank, above which, it can head back towards levels of 48,500 - 48,850 on the upside. Only a slip below the 50-DMA can drag it down to 47,500 - 47,400.The Nifty Bank holding above 48,000 indicates positive momentum for the index, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. The MACD indicator on the daily timeframe is also indicating overall strength. Immediate support is at 47,800, while 48,500 will act as a barrier.Nifty 50's May futures shed 0.3% or 33,325 shares on Saturday. They are now trading at a premium of 41.9 points from 31.6 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's May futures shed 0.9% or 21,405 shares in Open Interest on Saturday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 1.24 from 1.23.Aditya Birla Capital, Balrampur Chini, Bandhan Bank, Biocon, Birlasoft, GMR Airports, Granules India, Hindustan Copper, Vodafone Idea, India Cements, SAIL, Piramal Enterprises and Zee Entertainment continue to remain in the F&O ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes of 22,650 and 22,750 have seen Open Interest addition, while those of 22,400 and 22,450 have seen shedding in Open Interest.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 22,100 and 22,500 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's expiry.",

The weekly expiry session provided the perfect trade to the Nifty bulls and the bears alike, provided there was presence of mind of course, not to forget a little bit (read plenty) of luck.Until the final 40 minutes of the session, the day remained lacklustre, even negative for those who were expecting the Nifty to break past its 20 and 50-Day Moving Average courtesy of extremely positive global cues. Instead, the index was threatening to break below the 22,000 mark.From 2:50 PM onwards, it was one-way traffic. An extremely sharp bout of buying at lower levels led a 350-point recovery in the Nifty before close of trade. Leave 22,300, the index even surged past 22,400, eventually closing above it.Chartists have been citing 22,300 as a key level for the Nifty to break beyond to ensure further upside towards levels of 22,500 or even 22,600. This sharp recovery has ensured that the Nifty has now turned positive for the week with gains of 0.8%.The final full trading session for this extended week on Friday will see stocks like Vodafone Idea, Biocon, Crompton Greaves Consumer, eClerx Services, JK Paper, Restaurant Brands Asia among others react to their results that were reported after market hours on Thursday.Friday's session will also see stocks like JSW Steel, Astral, Bandhan Bank, Balrampur Chini, GMR Power, Godrej Industries, Phoenix Mills, Polyplex, RCF, RVNL and others report their March quarter earnings.Thursday's session saw foreign investors continue to remain net sellers, albeit the sell figure was in three digits compared to the usual four-digit trend over the last 7-10 trading sessions. Domestic investors continued to remain buyers and outnumbered the selling.Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities said that the 50-DMA level near 22,310, which was earlier a resistance for the Nifty, will now act as a support zone and the index will now face immediate resistance between 22,500 - 22,600 levels. The uptrend will now be vulnerable only on a slip below levels of 22,310, he added.The formation of long lower shadows for two in the last four trading sessions signals emergence of sharp buying on dips, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. He now expects the Nifty to test the next resistance level of 22,600 in the near term. On the downside, 22,280 will act as a support.Nifty will now see support at 22,300 is a sentiment echoed by Angel One's Osho Krishnan as well. He sees 22,500 - 22,600 to be in the vicinity of the bulls but warns that volatility could continue to remain high as the country is in the midst of an election.The Nifty Bank also staged a recovery from the day's low during the final minutes of Thursday's trading session. The index took support at the 47,350 level before a 600-point rebound led it to the cusp of 48,000, which it managed to cross intraday but could not close above that level. The Nifty Bank is now up 1.2% for the week recovering some of the 3% drop that it had witnessed last week.Neeraj Sharma of Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediates expects the bullish momentum in the Nifty Bank to continue till the index trades above levels of 46,980, which is 1,000 points lower than Thursday's close. Thursday's high of 48,052, where the 21-DEMA is also placed, will be the first barrier for the index, followed by 48,500, he added.The next immediate hurdle for the Nifty Bank is at 48,200, which is near the 20-Day Moving Average, said Kunal Shah of LKP Securities. A close above that level can trigger further short covering towards 49,000 levels. On the downside, 47,600 and 47,500 will act as a key support.Nifty 50's May futures shed 2.7% or 2.78 lakh shares in Open Interest on Thursday. They are now trading at a premium of 48.5 points compared to 69.2 points earlier. On the flip side, the Nifty Bank shed 2% or 50,010 shares in Open Interest on Thursday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 1.19 from 0.92 earlier.Bandhan Bank has entered the F&O ban, while LIC Housing is out of the ban.Balrampur Chini, Biocon, Birlasoft, GMR Airports, Granules India, Hindustan Copper, Vodafone Idea, India Cements, SAIL, Piramal Enterprises and Zee Entertainment continue to remain in the ban list.For next Thursday's weekly expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes of 22,400, 22,600 and 23,000 have seen Open Interest addition.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 22,000 and 22,400 have seen Open Interest addition for next Thursday's expiry.",

Cosmo Specialty Chemical should deliver double-digit EBITDA and 20%+ RoCE in FY25.\n\n\n\nThe bulls have a task ahead of them. That task is to ensure the Nifty crosses and sustains above its 50-Day Moving Average around the 22,300 mark. It made another attempt to do so on Wednesday, but failed. However, it did manage to end right at the mark of 22,200.It has been five trading sessions since the Nifty closed above the mark of 22,300. Although it recovered swiftly from Monday's swing low, the lack of positive triggers has kept any potential upside capped. Long story short, the Nifty isn't grinding lower, but is not surging towards its previous highs either.While the benchmark index has remained sluggish, the broader markets have continued to outperform. The Midcap index gained for the fourth straight day, and has now gained in five out of the last six sessions. The Smallcap index too ended higher and that may give the bulls some comfort. The VIX remaining flat for the second day in a row may also give some comfort.The bulls though, would hope for the fact that the Nifty does breakout from this 22,150 - 22,300 range on Thursday, which will also be the weekly options expiry. Indian equities are expected to see passive inflows worth over $2.5 billion post the MSCI rejig, according to Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research, adjustments for which will take place on May 31.Thursday's trading session will see stocks like Dixon Technologies, Mankind Pharma, Titagarh Rail, IEX, Transport Corporation of India and NLC India among others will react to their earnings reported after market hours on Wednesday.Mahindra & Mahindra will be among the last few Nifty names reporting results on Thursday, along with other broader market names like Biocon, Crompton Consumer, JK Paper, KIMS, Hindustan Aeronautics, Solar Industries and Motherson Sumi Wiring.Foreign institutions continued to remain net sellers in the cash market on Wednesday, taking the total sell figure in the last seven trading session past \u20b930,000 crore. On the flip side, domestic institutions continued to remain net buyers.Osho Krishnan advises to maintain the buy on dips and sell on rise strategy on the Nifty as support lies at levels of 22,150 - 22,100, followed by a bigger support at 22,000.The short-term trend of the Nifty is positive, according to Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities, who expects further consolidation or a minor dip before the market shows further upmove. He expects a surge towards levels of 22,600 only after the Nifty crosses the immediate resistance of 22,300. Downside support is at 22,070.LKP Securities' Rupak De expects the sentiment on the Nifty to remain subdued till it continues to trade below the 22,250 mark. On the flip side, a failure to sustain above 22,200 may invite further selling pressure.The Nifty Bank turned out to be an underperformer on its weekly expiry day, shaving off nearly 200 points after a two-day recovery. However, the index continues to trade near levels of 47,700 and still needs another 550 points to recover its losses and turn positive for 2024 once again.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediates said that the Nifty Bank is still respecting its bullish engulfing candle, indicating that the strength is intact. He expects the bullish momentum to sustain till the index trades above levels of 46,983. On the upside, the 21-DEMA near 48,060 will be the first hurdle for the index, followed by 48,500.A break above 48,100 for the Nifty Bank, which corresponds to the middle bollinger band, can push the index further higher towards levels of 48,550, said SAMCO Securities' Om Mehra. He added that a slip below 47,380 will indicate a bearish trend.Nifty 50's May futures shed 4% or 4.32 lakh shares in Open Interest. They are now trading at a premium of 69.2 points from 90.85 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's May futures added 4.5% and 1.04 lakh shares in Open Interest. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 0.92 from 1.02 earlier.Biocon, Granules India, India Cements and LIC Housing Finance have entered the F&O ban.Canara Bank is out of the F&O ban.Balrampur Chini, Birlasoft, GMR Airports, Hindustan Copper, Vodafone Idea, SAIL, Piramal Enterprises and Zee Entertainment remain in the F&O ban.For Thursday's weekly expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes between 22,200 and 22,400 have seen Open Interest addition.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 22,000 and 22,200 have seen Open Interest addition.",

The index has already recovered 400 points from Monday's low of 21,821, which the bulls would hope, becomes the latest swing low after 21,777 in April and 21,710 in March, which has now become a crucial downside support zone.The index traded in a range of nearly 200 points on Tuesday and continued to grind higher, eventually closing back above the mark of 22,200. On the upside though, the index faced resistance at the 22,300 mark, from where it reversed, eventually ending 50 points off the day's high. That 22,300 level, which also coincides with the 50-Day Moving Average of the index.Even as the index consolidated in a range, the broader markets had a field day. While the Midcap index continued Monday's recovery, the Smallcap index, which underperformed on Monday, ended 2% higher, led by autos, metals, PSU Banks and Oil & Gas stocks.The other major talking point of the day was the decline in the India Volatility Index or the VIX. The index ended lower on Tuesday, after surging for 13 sessions in a row and more than doubling during this period. Although the decline was not substantial as the index still remains above 20, it was a decline afterall.Wednesday's trading session will see stocks like Bharti Airtel, Colgate-Palmolive, Bharti Hexacom, Shree Cement, Siemens India, IdeaForge, Oberoi Realty, among others react to their earnings reported after market hours on Tuesday.On the other hand, stocks like Dixon Technologies, Mankind Pharma, Jyothy Laboratories, Pricol, PFC, IEX, MOIL, HPL Electric among other broader market names reporting results on Wednesday.Foreign institutions sold another \u20b94,000 crore worth of stock in the cash market on Tuesday, taking the overall sell tally for the last seven sessions to well over $3 billion. Domestic institutions continued to remain net buyers.A small positive candle was formed on the Nifty's daily chart, indicating a confirmation of the important higher bottom reversal at 21,820 levels, noted Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. The next upside levels, according to him are around 22,300 and 22,590 for the next one week. 22,080 will be a key downside support.Neeraj Sharma of Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediates also expects the relief rally to continue till the Nifty holds levels of 21,820 on the downside. He too expects a pullback towards levels of 22,300 and sustaining above 22,305 can even take the index higher to 22,500.On the intraday charts, the Nifty has formed a reversal formation and a trade above 22,000 will continue this setup towards levels of 22,225 or 22,300, said Kotak Securities' Shrikant Chouhan. Only a slip below 22,000 can drag the Nifty back towards levels of 21,850 or 21,800.Just like the Nifty, the Nifty Bank also consolidated on Tuesday, ending with modest gains and edging further close to the 48,000 mark. It has been four sessions since the index closed above the mark of 48,000. The index did make an intraday high near 47,950 on Tuesday but could not sustain those levels. Wednesday will also be the weekly options expiry of the Nifty Bank.The Nifty Bank needs to see a decisive move above resistance levels of 48,000, which will take it to the level of 48,500 on the upside, according to Kunal Shah of LKP Securities. On the downside, support is seen between 47,500 - 47,400 will present an ideal opportunity to go long in case of any dip towards this level.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities said that the Nifty Bank broke above the 40-EMA at 47,780 and sustained above the middle bollinger band on the hourly chart. He further added that a break above 48,100 can pave the way for 48,450 on the upside, while a drop below 47,400 may signal a shift in trend.Nifty 50's May futures shed 7.6% and 8.93 lakh shares in Open Interest. They are now trading at a premium of 90.85 points from 97.05 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's May futures added 2.6% and 59,985 shares in Open Interest on Tuesday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.02 from 0.96 earlier.Birlasoft has entered the F&O ban from today's session, while PNB is out of the ban.Balrampur Chini, Canara Bank, GMR Airports, Hindustan Copper, Vodafone Idea, SAIL, Piramal Enterprises, and Zee Entertainment remain in the F&O ban list.For this Thursday's weekly expiry, while the 22,250 and 22,500 strike calls of the Nifty have seen Open Interest addition, the 22,100 and 22,000 strikes have seen shedding in Open Interest.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 22,000 and 22,200 have seen Open Interest addition for Thursday's weekly expiry.",

Frontline equity indices Sensex and Nifty rebounded from their day's lows, finishing in positive territory after both experienced nearly a one percent decline during morning trading.Sensex rose 112 points to settle at 72,776 and Nifty closed at 22,104 level, up 49 points, while the Nifty Bank index jumped 333 points to 47,754 led by financials. The HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank contributed 80% to Nifty and Nifty Bank's gains.Pharma stocks also witnessed buying on upbeat management commentary from Cipla. The management expects margin to improve by 100 basis points year-on-year to 24.5-25.5% for FY25.Meanwhile, foreign investors continued to remain net sellers in India, while domestic investors remained buyers in the cash market on May 13. FIIs sold \u20b94,499 crore and DIIs bought \u20b93,563 crore in equities.Though the market reversed from the day's low and ended up with a marginal gain, investors remain concerned over the progressing general election and high valuation, according to Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.An absence of major positive triggers and the flight of FIIs from the domestic market is expected to keep the short-term trend weak, Bair said.Investors now remain watchful ahead of the release of India and US inflation data and the US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's speech to get a near-term direction.\"The week kicked off with market volatility, but by the end, it managed to eke out marginal gains. Initially bearish sentiments gave way to a recovery, particularly among key heavyweights, which not only erased losses but also propelled the index to close near the day\u2019s peak at 22,125.50,\" said Ajit Mishra \u2013 SVP, Research at Religare Broking.Has the Nifty 50's recovery today given a ray of hope to the bulls and the chartists? Lets find out:According to Rupak De of LKP Securities, the Nifty has formed a hammer pattern on the daily chart, indicating a potential bullish reversal following a correction.\"Additionally, the stock has found support around the previous swing low on the daily timeframe. However, the index's recovery may encounter resistance in the 22150-22200 zone, and only a decisive move above 22200 could trigger a stronger rally in the market. On the lower end, support is situated at 21950,\" De said.\"Nifty closed with bullish 'hammer' candlestick pattern on the daily chart, which indicates short term bullish trend reversal. On the higher side band 22300-22320 could act as a resistance, while low of 21821, registered today would remain support for the Nifty in the short term. Nifty witnessed almost 1000 points from an all-time high of 22794. Nifty managed to maintain its level above the previous swing low of 21777,\" said Vinay Rajani, CMT, Senior Technical/Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities.Rajani said that the Bank Nifty index broke the nine-day's losing streak by closing with a gain of 365 points. \"From the low of the day, Bank Nifty recovered more than 800 points to close at 47786. Resistance for the Bank-Nifty is seen in the band of 48200-48300, while support for the same lies in the zone of 46900-47000 band.\"Kunal Shah of LKP Securities said the Bank Nifty index saw a strong recovery from lower levels and managed to hold onto its support at the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA). There's a potential for a pullback towards its 20-day moving average (DMA), positioned at 48,200, he said.As long as the index maintains the support level of 47,200 on the downside, where bullish activity is evident, the index remains in a buy mode, Shah added.The Nifty 50 futures across series' shed 0.7% in Open Interest on Monday. The Nifty May futures are trading at a premium of 97.05 points, compared to 85.40 points earlier.

There was no relief rally as such on Friday, but the fact that the index did not shed any more points on the downside and ended with modest gains was relief in itself. While the Nifty prevented a worst week in six months, it did have its worst weekly drop in two months.The other key factor is that the Nifty has managed to somehow hold on to the 22,000 mark on a weekly basis. It has not closed below 22,000 for the week since February this year.Friday's move by no means signifies a trend reversal. The Nifty faced resistance at 22,150 and failed to cross those levels, ending 80 points off the day's high.The handover from Wall Street is also a positive one after the Dow posted its eighth day of gains and its best week of 2024. However, that has been the case through most of last week as well. But Indian equities are plagued with jitters of their own. Election related uncertainties, consistent FII outflows, and some bit of exuberance in certain sections of the broader market, have all kept the market on the edge.India's Volatility Index is also nearing the levels of 19, which were last seen in October 2022. The index rose for the 12th day in a row on Friday, ending at levels of 18.47. CNBC-TV18's Nigel D'Souza explained the parallels of the VIX from 2019 and the current scenario in this video below.Foreign investors continued to remain net sellers on Friday as well in the cash market, taking their overall selling for the week to well over \u20b921,000 crore or nearly $2.3 billion. Domestic institutions however, remained net buyers.Amol Athawale of Kotak Securities expects a pullback rally from current levels due to the temporary oversold conditions. He sees the Nifty bounce towards 22,200 levels or till the 50-DMA of 22,300. Athawale also anticipates fresh selling below levels of 21,950, which can drag the index to levels of 21,700.The possibility of a minor upside bounce is also echoed by HDFC Securities' Nagaraj Shetti. However, he also sees an eventual breakdown of the 21,900 - 21,850 support zone and the Nifty to fall towards 21,700 - 21,600 levels in the near-term. Immediate upside resistance is seen at 22,300.LKP Securities' Rupak De expects the trend to remain weak in the near term, with resistance seen at levels of 22,200. He advises a sell-on-rallies trade till the Nifty remains below that level. On the downside, support is at 21,950, a slip below which can accelerate the selling pressure.While the Nifty saw some semblance of rebound from lower levels, the same could not be said for the banking index. Although the index was flat on Friday, it ended with a negative bias and continued to trade below the 47,500 mark. The 3% drop for the week on the Nifty Bank was the worst seen by the index since January this year. Despite brokerages anticipating shares of State Bank of India heading towards \u20b91,000 in the next 12 months, the stock witnessed no cheer on Friday.Neeraj Sharma of Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediates said that the weakness in the Nifty Bank will continue till it remains below the 48,000 mark. On the downside, key supports now lie at the 100-DEMA level of 47,055 and only a move above 48,000 can take the index back towards 48,300 and 48,500.The weaker trend on the Nifty Bank is evident on its hourly charts, according to SAMCO Securities' Om Mehra. He sees a key support on the downside at 47,000 for the Nifty Bank, followed by 46,900.Nifty 50 May futures shed 3.7% or 4.52 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday. They are now trading at a premium of 118.3 points compared to 91.3 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's May futures shed 1% or 24,420 shares in Open Interest. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 0.91 from 0.9 earlier.Hindustan Copper has entered the F&O ban, while Aditya Birla Fashion and Piramal Enterprises are out of the ban.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 22,000 and 22,500 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 22,000 and 22,100 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's expiry.",

It had given a brief close below 22,000 on April 18 as well, but staged a rebound soon after. On Thursday, the dip was swift and expiry-related pressures ensured that dip did not find buyers at lower levels. The fact that the index closed just 25 points away from the day's low, does not inspire much confidence either.Over 50% of Thursday's drop on the Nifty came from just four index constituents - HDFC Bank (58.4 points to the downside), L&T (56 points to the downside), Reliance Industries (36 points to the downside) and ITC (31 points).After Thursday's drop, and a slip below the 22,000 mark, the two recent swing lows for the Nifty are back in focus. First is the April 19 low of 21,777, which is now just 150 points away and then of course, the March 20 low of 21,710, from which the Nifty began a 1,000 point rally to its latest record high.It is hard to find gainers in a market like Thursday's. Yet, SBI turned out to be the only saving grace when the screen was a sea of red. India's largest lender stunned the street in a positive way on the loan growth front, while also reporting record profit and a nine-year low asset quality. Also in the green was Tata Motors, which outperformed ahead of its own results on Friday.With over \u20b97 lakh crore worth of investor wealth being wiped off on Thursday, the Nifty is now down 2.3% for the week. As of Thursday's close, this is the worst week for the Nifty in 2024 and is just a few points away from becoming the worst week since September 2023.One must never say never, but the Nifty needs a 500-plus point rally on Friday to close above levels of 22,475 and post a weekly advance.On the charts, the Nifty is hurtling down to oversold setups after this week. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of the Nifty is currently at 37.92. An RSI reading below 30 indicates that the index or stock is oversold.Stocks like BPCL, Mahanagar Gas, Relaxo Footwear, Gopal Snacks, Quess Corp, Rain Industries among others will be reacting to their quarterly results reported after market hours on Thursday. On the other hand, Tata Motors, Eicher Motors, Cipla, Polycab, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Kalyan Jewellers among others will be reporting results on Friday.Foreign institutions remained heavy sellers in the cash market on Thursday as well. In the four sessions so far this week, FII selling has been worth \u20b919,502 crore. On the other hand, domestic institutions continued to try offsetting the selling pressure.Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities said that 22,000 is now the key level to watch for the Nifty, below which the weak sentiment is likely to continue to levels of 21,800 on the downside. He observed the formation of a long bearish candle on the Nifty's daily charts, which supports further weakness.The Nifty has nearing the lower end of a 21,750 - 22,800 range and has bounced decently from these levels in the past, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities who does see a higher probability of a minor upside bounce from these levels. Immediate resistance is seen at 22,100 levels.Angel One's Rajesh Bhosale is of the view that the next critical levels to watch for the Nifty lie between 21,750 and 21,700. He advises using any rebound to reduce long positions and avoid bottom fishing until clear signs of reversal emerge. 22,150 - 22,200 now are immediate resistance levels for the Nifty.The Nifty Bank has now declined in six out of the last seven trading sessions. Even as the quantum of the fall on Thursday was not as severe as the Nifty, the Nifty Bank has violated some key support levels on the downside, even closing below the 47,500 mark on Friday. The index is now down 3% for the week so far and is set for its worst weekly performance since January this year.The Nifty Bank RSI has now shifted below 45, indicating increasing bearish momentum, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. He now sees 46,580, the previous swing low, as a key support for the Nifty Bank. He also advises refraining from any long positions till the Nifty Bank crosses the 48,200 mark.Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediates said that the next key support for the Nifty Bank lies at the 100-DEMA of 47,050, and only a move above the previous support level of 47,700 can take the index back to levels of 48,200 and 48,500 on the upside.Nifty 50's May futures added 14.1% and 15.1 lakh shares in Open Interest on Thursday. They are trading at a premium of 118.3 points from 91.35 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's May futures added 8.8% and 1.1 lakh shares in Open Interest on Thursday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is at 0.9 from 0.77 earlier.Biocon is out of the F&O ban. But Aditya Birla Fashion, Vodafone Idea, Balrampur Chini, GMR Airports, SAIL, PNB, Zee Entertainment, Canara Bank and Piramal Enterprises continue to remain in the ban.For next week's weekly expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes between 22,100 and 22,500 have seen Open Interest addition.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 21,500 and 22,000 have seen Open Interest addition for next week's expiry.",

It happened on Wednesday. Not a smidge here, nor there. While the index did slip below the 22,200 mark at one point, it staged a recovery from the lows of 22,185. Autos and Metals contributed to that recovery.PSU Banks too, after shedding nearly \u20b91 lakh crore in market capitalisation across Monday and Tuesday, staged a rebound ahead of State Bank of India 's results on Thursday.The India VIX though, showed no signs of cooling off. That index continues to remain above the mark of 17 and gained for the ninth day in a row. Wednesday's no move day means that the Nifty remains 500 points below its recent record high of 22,794.Thursday will not only be the weekly options expiry for the Nifty 50 contracts, but a slew of Nifty and broader market names will also be announcing their results.Stocks like L&T, Tata Power, TVS Motor, Godrej Agrovet, Sula Vineyards among others will react to results reported after market hours on Wednesday.On Thursday, stocks like State Bank of India , Asian Paints, BPCL among the Nifty names and HPCL, MGL, PNB, Quess Corp, Rain Industries, Relaxo Footwear among the broader markets will report numbers. In fact, HPCL and BPCL will also consider proposals to issue bonus shares.For Wednesday's trading session, foreign investors continued to remain heavy sellers in the cash market, while domestic investors were net buyers.The short-term texture of the market still remains on the weak side, said Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities. He believes that the 50-DMA around 22,350 will be the key level to watch as till the time it remains below that level, the Nifty can retest levels of 22,150 - 22,100.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities also agreed that the short-term Nifty trend remains weak but the index is showing signs of a higher bottom formation at around 22,200 levels. That remains the immediate support for the Nifty, while immediate resistance on the upside is at 22,500.As long as the Nifty remains below the 22,400 mark, this short-term weakness will persist, as per Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediates. He expects the index to find strong support between levels of 22,100 - 22,000 and expects a consolidation between the 22,000 and 22,800 range.The Nifty Bank continues to remain the underperformer and despite the support from PSU banks, the index failed to find any signs of a rebound as private banks continued to put pressure on the downside. The index did slip below the 48,000 mark intraday but found support near the crucial 47,800 levels. All eyes will remain on the index on Thursday as SBI reports its earnings for the March quarter. In five trading sessions, the Nifty Bank has corrected nearly 2,000 points from the record high of 49,974.Kunal Shah of LKP Securities said that the next support for the index remains at 47,770, which coincides with the 50-Day Moving Average. 48,250 remains the immediate hurdle on the upside, above which, the index can move towards levels of 48,400 and 48,500.The immediate swing support for the Nifty Bank is at 47,740, said Asit C Mehta's Neeraj Sharma. In case the Nifty Bank maintains its support level, a relief rally towards 48,400 - 48,600 is possible.Nifty 50's May futures added 1.2% or 1.2 lakh shares in Open Interest on Wednesday.

This is a trend witnessed through most of the last 10 trading sessions, particularly in four out of the last five. Even after opening with steady gains and building on them during Monday's session, the index began to turn downwards within 15 minutes of trade starting. Eventually, the Nifty ended 150 points of the day's high of 22,588.Multiple factors contributed to the sour sentiment on Monday despite global cues being very positive. The Reserve Bank of India's draft guidelines on project financing sent PSU Banks tumbling down with the index falling nearly 4% in its biggest single-day drop in two months. The PSU Bank index shed market capitalisation worth \u20b957,000 crore on Monday.The other sector impacted due to the RBI draft guidelines were power financiers. REC, PFC and IREDA fell anywhere between 4% to 9% on Monday. You can read more about them here. Losses seen in the Smallcap universe, Metals and Media stocks, offset the gains reported by FMCG, IT and Real Estate.Another worrying factor for the bulls will be the rise in the India Volatility Index (India VIX), which hit a 52-week high on Monday. Just a few sessions earlier on April 23, the index had declined 20% in a single session to slip below levels of 10. Since then, it has risen 70% in eight sessions to hit levels over 16 on Monday. More on that here. Foreign investors remained net sellers in the cash market on Monday, while domestic institutions were net buyers, albeit for a smaller quantum.The Nifty is currently placed at the support between 22,400 and 22,300 levels and is not able to sustain its intraday upside bounces, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. The short-term trend of the Nifty is negative but he sees the possibility of an upside bounce in case 22,300 is held on the downside. A slip below that may trigger further weakness.Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities said that the index has formed a bearish candle on the intraday charts and is holding the lower top formation, which is largely negative. As long as the Nifty remains below 22,600, the chances of it falling to 22,300 - 22,250 levels are higher. On the flip side, only a move above 22,600 can take the index back to 22,735 levels.Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediates' Neeraj Sharma is of the view that the Nifty has formed a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern, followed by today's red candle, indicating further weakness. A slip below 22,340 can take the index down to 22,100 or even 22,000 levels, he added.While 50,000 was almost in sight for the Nifty Bank just last week, the index is now struggling to hold on to levels of 49,000. Although less choppy than the Nifty, the banking index traded in a 500-point band and was mainly dragged lower on Monday due to the underperformance of PSU banks.48,300 is an important level for the Nifty Bank and as long as that holds, the overall trend remains positive, said Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities. He expects the Nifty Bank to remain sideways in a 48,300 - 49,300 range. Only a move on either side of this range can determine the further trend for the index.Kunal Shah of LKP Securities said the immediate resistance for the Nifty Bank is at 49,300 and a move above that can trigger further upside towards 49,500 levels. On the flip side, a break below 48,900 may induce further selling pressure.Nifty 50's May futures added 5.7% and 6 lakh shares in Open Interest on Monday. They are now trading at a premium of 107.45 points from 99.35 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's May futures added 2.4% or 47,640 shares in Open Interest on Monday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 0.85 from 0.89 earlier.SAIL has entered the F&O ban, joining Aditya Birla Fashion, Biocon, Vodafone Idea, Balrampur Chini and GMR Airports.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 22,500 and 22,800 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.On the Put side, while the 22,300 and 22,400 strikes have seen Open Interest addition, the 22,700 strike has seen shedding for this Thursday's expiry.",

At one point, the Nifty looked towards reclaiming the 22,800 mark but come the second half of the session, the Nifty barely managed to hold on to 22,350 on the downside, saw a modest recovery from the lows and just about managed to hold on to some weekly gains.The index did recover 120 points from the lows on Friday but closed below the 22,500 mark. Crossing that level will be the key for the index first up, as it has been a key support in recent times. Despite making a new high during the week, the Nifty almost ended with negative weekly returns.Another thing to note is the sharp surge in the Volatility index or the VIX, which, after the 20% fall on April 23, has risen 40% in the last seven trading sessions to levels near 15. The VIX rose nearly 9% on Friday as well.What the bulls can take heart from is the fact that the handover from Wall Street on Friday night has been a positive one. US markets rallied on Friday after a softer-than-expected jobs report in April boosted hopes that the US Federal Reserve will start cutting rates soon. All the three benchmark indices also had a positive weekly close.On the other side earnings season continues with some big Nifty names reporting results after market hours on Friday and over the weekend. Prominent among them is Kotak Mahindra Bank, which lost another 4% last week after an 11% drop in the week before. The management also spoke about the exit of KVS Manian, saying that he does not have anything in hand as of now to the best of their knowledge.Other stocks that reported results over the weekend include Titan, Britannia, Avenue Supermarts, and Inox Wind. Some important names that will report results on Monday include Godrej Consumer, Marico, Gujarat Gas, CG Power, Happiest Minds, Lupin and others.Foreign institutions were heavy sellers during Friday's trading session in the cash market, while domestic institutions were net buyers.Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com believes that although the short-term trend remains positive, one should remain very stock specfic and cautious till the Nifty crosses the 22,800 mark on the upside. On the downside 22,300 remains an important support for the Nifty, which if broken, can lead to downward moves towards 22,000 or even 21,900.Nifty's short-term trend seems to have reversed downwards, is the view of HDFC Securities' Nagaraj Shetti. He expecta short-term downward correction in the coming sessions after the higher top of the bullish pattern was completed at levels of 22,794. Immediate resistance on the upside is 22,600, while support is at 22,120.For the time being, we would remain neutral and the Nifty Bank will be key to strengthen the Nifty momentum in the upcoming week, said Osho Krishnan of Angel One. 22,350 - 22,300 will be a key support for the Nifty, followed by the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average of 22,230 and 22,200. On the upside, 22,750 - 22,800 remains a challenge for the bulls.Speaking of the Nifty Bank, the index also fell in line with the Nifty on Friday but that is also because of specific constituents being plagued with issues of their own. The reaction to Kotak Mahindra Bank on Monday will be key to which way the index moves.The index is already down 1,000 points from its record high of 49,975 and while it was set for levels of 50,000, it now closed below 49,000 last Friday, but still managed to end 1.5% higher for the week.For the short term, 48,500 and 48,300 will be key levels for the Nifty Bank on the downside and a sustained move below 48,342 wil trigger further weakness, said Hrishikesh Yedve of Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediates. On the upside, 49,500 and 50,000 will continue to act as barriers.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities said that the hourly chart of the Nifty Bank reveals a weakening trend with a lower highs, lower lows formation. Immediate support is seen at 48,340, which is near the 20-DMA, while resistance on the upside is at 49,400.Immediate resistance for the Nifty Bank is at 49,200, above which the index can head back to 49,500, said LKP Securities' Kunal Shah. However, a break of downside supports between 48,800 and 48,700, may drag the index further down towards its 20-Day Moving Average of 48,340.Nifty 50's May futures shed 5.4% or 5.96 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday. They are now trading at a premium of 99.35 points from 125.75 points earlier. On the other hand, Nifty Bank's May futures shed 8.7% or 1.9 lakh shares in Open Interest on Friday. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 0.89 from 1.27 earlier.Balrampur Chini and GMR Airports are in the F&O ban today along with Aditya Birla Fashion, Biocon and Vodafone Idea.On the Call side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 22,500 and 22,800 have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's weekly expiry.On the Put side, while 22,000 to 22,000 strikes have seen Open Interest addition for this Thursday's expiry, the 22,700 strike has seen Open Interest shedding.",

Manganese ore sales up 17% from last year to 1.15 lakh tonnes.\n\n\n\nThe truncated week has turned out to be a decent one for the Nifty but the last two days have been dodgy. Index heavyweights in the form of private banks are keeping the Nifty upside in check. The weekly options expiry session on Thursday followed a script similar to Thursday.While there was negative newsflow surrounding Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank also followed suit. In fact, considering its weightage in the index, ICICI Bank turned out to be a bigger drag compared to Kotak, while Axis also put pressure on the downside.Together, ICICI Bank, Kotak Bank and Axis Bank contributed 43 points to the index downside, a move which was partly offset by one HDFC Bank, which contributed 20 points to the upside. As a result, the Nifty traded in a 140-point range but could not sustain above the 22,700 mark.Despite the volatility in the last two sessions, the Nifty is still up a percent this truncated week. This will be the second straight weekly gain for the index, if it manages a close above the mark of 22,419.For Friday's trading session, stocks like Coal India, Ajanta Pharma, Coforge, KEI Industries among others will react to their results reported after market hours on Thursday.Among the results being reported, Britannia and Titan are among the Nifty names, while Adani Green Energy, Inox Wind, Godrej properties, JSW Infra, Tata Technologies, MRPL from the broader markets will also report numbers for the March quarter.For Thursday's trading session, foreign institutions returned to being net sellers in the cash market, while domestic institutions continued their buying spree.Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said that the short-term trend of the Nifty is choppy but rangebound. Any upside from here can face strong resistance at 22,800 with immediate support at 22,550 and a slide below that can trigger some more weakness ahead.The current market texture is non-directional according to Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities. For the bulls, he sees 22,750 as an immediate breakout level, above which the Nifty can move up towards levels of 22,850. On the flip side, a slip below 22,570 may drag the index lower towards levels of 22,400.Sustaining at higher levels showcases a bullish undertone for the Nifty is the view of Angel One's Osho Krishnan. However, 22,800 remains a key hurdle for the bulls, only above which, the Nifty can head towards levels of 23,000.The Nifty Bank is the weaker among the two indices courtesy of the underperformance of heavyweight banks. The index is now down over 750 points from Tuesday's high of 49,975 and ended lower for the second day in a row on Thursday. Despite the choppy moves from record highs, the index is still up over 2% for the week.On the daily charts, the Nifty Ban has formked a shooting star candlestick pattern near the upper end of the trend line resistance and has sustained below the shooting star candle on Thursday, indicating further weakness, said Neeraj Sharma of Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediates. He further said that till the index does not cross its previous high of 49,975, a retracement towards 48,500 levels cannot be ruled out.Nifty 50's May futures added 2.5% or 2.71 lakh shares in Open Interest on Thursday. They are now trading at a premium of 125.75 points compared to 113.45 points earlier. On the other hand, the Nifty Bank's May futures shed 4.1% or 92,310 shares in Open Interest. Nifty 50's Put-Call Ratio is now at 1.27 from 1.1 earlier.Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail has joined Biocon and Vodafone Idea among the stocks in the F&O ban.For next week's expiry, the Nifty 50 Call strikes between 22,700 and 23,000 have seen Open Interest addition.On the Put side, the Nifty 50 strikes between 22,500 and 22,700 have seen Open Interest addition for next Thursday's expiry.",

A 180-point drop after hitting a new record, within 60 minutes may not have pleased the bulls, but on paper, a new record for the Nifty was registered on Tuesday at 22,783.In fact, the Nifty erased all the intraday gains and ended with losses on Tuesday. Trading resumes on Thursday after a day off and that will mark the weekly options expiry session.The street will also react to the FOMC interest rate decision where the central bank left interest rates unchanged but Chair Jerome Powell pretty much ruled out a rate hike as the Fed's next move.There is plenty of data that the market has to digest over the last two days. Earnings that were reported after market hours on Tuesday, those that were reported on Wednesday, Auto sales for March, the Godrej Group split, announcements made by the Jindal Group, Windfall tax, and other macro data too.Stocks like Havells, IndiaMART, Castrol, Sona BLW, Ambuja Cements, Adani Total Gas among others will be reacting to their earnings reported over the last two days. Also reporting earnings on Thursday are stocks like Coal India, Dabur, Ajanta Pharma, Blue Star, Ceat, Ramkrishna Forgings, Coforge and others. Ajanta Pharma will also be considering a share buyback on Thursday.Despite the volatility witnessed during the final hour of trade on Tuesday, both foreign and domestic institutions were net buyers in the cash market.Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com observed that the RSI oscillator on the lower timeframe charts of the Nifty has given a negative crossover, which points to a possible correction within an uptrend. In case of a correction further, the Nifty may find some support at 22,450, but a break above 22,784 on the upside will result in the trend continuing towards 23,000. He advises traders to continue with a positive bias but book some profits at higher levels.Traders are advised to view dips as potential buying opportunities, said Osho Krishnan of Angel One. Immediate support for the Nifty may shift higher towards 22,500, followed by 22,400, while 22,800 on the upside will be a barrier before the index heads towards 23,000.Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediates' Hrishikesh Yedve believes that the Nifty may see a short-term retracement back towards 22,500 - 22,300 until it remains below the 22,800 mark, above which, it can head towards 23,000 - 23,100 levels.The Nifty Bank was due for a landmark on Thursday and it came within 25 points of doing so, but the correction in the final 60 minutes dashed all hopes of the index scaling the mark of 50,000. The index fell 600 points from the day's high on Tuesday, even closing below the 49,500 mark as some expiry related volatility also took it lower.Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities said that the primary trend for the Nifty Bank remains positive until it continues to trade above levels of 48,600. In the short-term, he advises any dip in the index as buying opportunities.Overall sentiment for the Nifty Bank remains bullish was also the sentiment shared by LKP Securities' Kunal Shah. Even he advises using the dips as a buying opportunity with 49,000 as a strong support, considering the heavy Put writing seen there.Nifty 50's May futures added 0.4% or 39,750 shares on Tuesday.
