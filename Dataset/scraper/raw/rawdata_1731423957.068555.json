The index gained half a percent with very low volume on the Muhurat trading day, closing just above 24,300. For the week, the index snapped a four-week losing streak, defending the previous week's low, which is a positive sign. It is unlikely to see a major uptrend until it decisively closes above 24,800, the 50-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average), and volatility sees a significant drop. Until then, rangebound trading may continue, with immediate resistance at the 24,450-24,500 zone and support at the 24,000 mark, experts said.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nHere are 15 data points we have collated to help you spot profitable trades:\n\n1) Key Levels For The Nifty 50 (24,304)\n\nResistance based on pivot points: 24,312, 24,372, and 24,406\n\nSupport based on pivot points: 24,284, 24,263, and 24,230\n\nSpecial Formation: The Nifty 50 formed a Doji-like candlestick pattern on the daily charts, indicating indecisive buyers and sellers regarding the future market trend. The index remains below the 10-, 20-, 50-, and 100-day EMAs, which is a negative sign, though the momentum indicator RSI (Relative Strength Index) shows a positive crossover. For the week, the index formed a small bullish candlestick pattern with upper and lower shadows, resembling a Doji-like pattern on the weekly timeframe, while defending the previous week's low, which is a positive sign.\n\n2) Key Levels For The Bank Nifty\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nResistance based on pivot points: 51,707, 51,879, and 52,019\n\nSupport based on pivot points: 51,513, 51,427, and 51,287\n\nResistance based on Fibonacci retracement: 52,332, 52,835\n\nSupport based on Fibonacci retracement: 51,258, 50,264\n\nSpecial Formation: The Bank Nifty formed a bullish candlestick pattern with a small upper shadow on the daily timeframe, climbing above the middle of the Bollinger band, which is a positive sign as long as it sustains above it.

This level can act as a key resistance level for the Nifty in the short term.

If the ratio falls below 0.7 or moves towards 0.5, then it indicates selling in Calls is higher than selling in Puts, reflecting a bearish mood in the market.\n\n9) India VIX\n\nVolatility extended its upward journey for the fourth consecutive session and continued to hit fresh two-and-a-half-month highs, making the trend uncomfortable for bulls. The India VIX rose by 2.27 percent to the 15.9 level, sustaining above all key moving averages, which is a negative sign for bulls.\n\n10) Long Build-up (64 Stocks)\n\nA long build-up was seen in 64 stocks. An increase in open interest (OI) and price indicates a build-up of long positions.\n\n11) Long Unwinding (20 Stocks)\n\n20 stocks saw a decline in open interest (OI) along with a fall in price, indicating long unwinding.\n\n12) Short Build-up (47 Stocks)\n\n47 stocks saw an increase in OI along with a fall in price, indicating a build-up of short positions.\n\n13) Short-Covering (47 Stocks)\n\n47 stocks saw short-covering, meaning a decrease in OI, along with a price increase.\n\n14) High Delivery Trades\n\nHere are the stocks that saw a high share of delivery trades.

This rally was primarily backed by banks on October 29. Therefore, until the Nifty 50 decisively closes above 24,500, further upward movement is challenging. Above this level, the immediate resistance zone to watch is 24,600-24,700, followed by 24,800-24,900. However, support remains in the 24,100-24,000 range, according to experts.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nHere are 15 data points we have collated to help you spot profitable trades:\n\n1) Key Levels For The Nifty 50\n\nResistance based on pivot points: 24,495, 24,576, and 24,708\n\nSupport based on pivot points: 24,233, 24,152, and 24,020\n\nSpecial Formation: The Nifty 50 formed a bullish candlestick pattern with a lower shadow on the daily charts, indicating buying interest at lower levels, with above-average volumes. However, it is still trading below the 20-, 50-, and 100-day EMAs. The momentum indicator RSI (Relative Strength Index) showed a positive crossover, which is a favourable sign.\n\n2) Key Levels For The Bank Nifty\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nResistance based on pivot points: 52,396, 52,650, and 53,061\n\nSupport based on pivot points: 51,574, 51,320, and 50,909\n\nResistance based on Fibonacci retracement: 52,835, 53,552\n\nSupport based on Fibonacci retracement: 51,266, 50,273\n\nSpecial Formation: The Bank Nifty recorded a long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe with above-average volumes for another session, rising 2.07 percent to 52,321.

This level can act as a key resistance level for the Nifty in the short term. It was followed by the 25,500 strike (74.88 lakh contracts), and the 24,500 strike (71.22 lakh contracts).\n\nMaximum Call writing was observed at the 24,700 strike, which saw an addition of 15.5 lakh contracts, followed by the 25,500 and 25,100 strikes, which added 7.66 lakh and 5.64 lakh contracts, respectively. The maximum Call unwinding was seen at the 24,500 strike, which shed 12.19 lakh contracts, followed by the 24,400 and 25,200 strikes, which shed 9.5 lakh and 8.08 lakh contracts, respectively.\n\n4) Nifty Put Options Data\n\nOn the Put side, the 24,000 strike holds the maximum open interest (with 87.21 lakh contracts), which can act as a key support level for the Nifty. It was followed by the 23,500 strike (64.68 lakh contracts), and the 24,400 strike (56.16 lakh contracts).\n\nThe maximum Put writing was placed at the 23,700 strike, which saw an addition of 14.57 lakh contracts, followed by the 24,400, and 24,000 strikes, with 13.76 lakh, and 13.19 lakh contracts added, respectively, while the Put unwinding was seen at the 23,800 strike, which shed 2.98 lakh contracts, followed by the 25,000, and 24,800 strikes, which shed 1.23 lakh and 97,500 contracts, respectively.\n\n5) Bank Nifty Call Options Data\n\nAccording to the monthly options data, the maximum open interest was seen at the 53,000 strike, with 32.49 lakh contracts.

If the ratio falls below 0.7 or moves towards 0.5, then it indicates selling in Calls is higher than selling in Puts, reflecting a bearish mood in the market.\n\n9) India VIX\n\nVolatility has remained up and down within a small range for more than a week now, hovering around the key moving averages. The India VIX, the fear indicator, rose 1.57 percent to 14.52, up from 14.29 levels. As long as it sustains below the 15 mark on a closing basis, buying interest may increase in the coming days, experts say.\n\n10) Long Build-up (57 Stocks)\n\nA long build-up was seen in 57 stocks.

A high share of delivery reflects investing (as opposed to trading) interest in a stock.\n\n15) Stocks Under F&O Ban\n\nSecurities banned under the F&O segment include companies where derivative contracts cross 95 percent of the market-wide position limit.\n\nStocks added to F&O ban: Nil\n\nStocks retained in F&O ban: IDFC First Bank, IndiaMART InterMESH, L&T Finance, Manappuram Finance, Punjab National Bank, RBL Bank\n\nStocks removed from F&O ban: Dixon Technologies, Escorts Kubota\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Considering the formation of Inverted Hammer and Doji patterns in the last couple of days, some bounce cannot be ruled out in the upcoming sessions. However, the overall trend remains in favour of the bears; hence, experts advised continuing with a 'sell on rally' strategy. On the upside, 24,500-24,600 may serve as resistance for the index, while a break below 24,300 could drag it down sharply.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nHere are 15 data points we have collated to help you spot profitable trades:\n\n1) Key Levels For The Nifty 50\n\nResistance based on pivot points: 24,460, 24,493, and 24,547\n\nSupport based on pivot points: 24,354, 24,321, and 24,268\n\nSpecial Formation: The Nifty 50 formed a Doji-like candlestick pattern on the daily charts, following an Inverted Hammer pattern in the previous session. This comes after a recent fall and generally indicates a potential reversal in trend. However, the lower highs and lows formation has persisted, with the index trading below the 100-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and the 20-week EMA. Furthermore, the momentum indicators RSI (Relative Strength Index) and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) maintain a negative crossover, indicating weakness in the short term.\n\n2) Key Levels For The Bank Nifty\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nResistance based on pivot points: 51,726, 51,863, and 52,085\n\nSupport based on pivot points: 51,283, 51,147, and 50,925\n\nResistance based on Fibonacci retracement: 51,823, 52,331\n\nSupport based on Fibonacci retracement: 50,687, 49,648\n\nSpecial Formation: The Bank Nifty formed a bullish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe, defending the 100-day EMA and reporting a higher high-higher low formation. However, it remains below the 20-day and 50-day EMAs, as well as the 20-day SMA (Simple Moving Average), which are crucial levels for an upward move. The index was up 292 points at 51,531 but lost 250 points from its day's high. The momentum indicator RSI showed a positive crossover on Thursday. On the weekly scale, the index fell by 1 percent and formed a bearish candlestick pattern while sustaining the higher highs-higher lows formation for another week.\n\n3) Nifty Call Options Data\n\nAccording to the weekly options data, the 24,400 strike holds the maximum open interest (with 2.46 crore contracts). This level can act as a key level for the Nifty in the short term.

The Call unwinding was seen at the 25,000 strike, which shed 42.95 lakh contracts, followed by the 24,800 and 24,700 strikes, which shed 26.06 lakh and 17.36 lakh contracts, respectively.\n\n4) Nifty Put Options Data\n\nOn the Put side, the maximum open interest was seen at the 24,400 strike (with 3.15 crore contracts), which can act as a key level for the Nifty. It was followed by the 24,300 strike (70.48 lakh contracts), and the 24,000 strike (70.14 lakh contracts).\n\nThe maximum Put writing was placed at the 24,400 strike, which saw an addition of 2.6 crore contracts, followed by the 24,300, and 23,900 strikes, with 35.39 lakh, and 25.52 lakh contracts added, respectively, while the Put unwinding was seen at the 23,500 strike, which shed 14.96 lakh contracts, followed by the 24,500, and 23,600 strikes, which shed 9.95 lakh and 9.74 lakh contracts, respectively.\n\n5) Bank Nifty Call Options Data\n\nAccording to the monthly options data, the 52,500 strike holds the maximum open interest, with 23.96 lakh contracts. This can act as a key resistance level for the index in the short term. It was followed by the 52,000 strike (19.88 lakh contracts) and the 53,000 strike (19.77 lakh contracts).\n\nMaximum Call writing was visible at the 52,500 strike (with the addition of 11.01 lakh contracts), followed by the 53,000 strike (4.49 lakh contracts) and the 52,000 strike (4.21 lakh contracts), while the maximum Call unwinding was seen at the 51,200 strike, which shed 1.45 lakh contracts, followed by the 51,400 and 51,300 strikes, which shed 85,500 and 55,095 contracts, respectively.\n\n6) Bank Nifty Put Options Data\n\nOn the Put side, the maximum open interest was seen at the 51,000 strike (with 20.06 lakh contracts), which can act as a key support level for the index.

If the ratio falls below 0.7 or moves towards 0.5, then it indicates selling in Calls is higher than selling in Puts, reflecting a bearish mood in the market.\n\n9) India VIX\n\nVolatility snapped a three-day upward move and closed just below the 14 mark. Bulls may not be in a comfortable zone until volatility remains below this level. The India VIX, the fear indicator, fell by 4.46 percent to 13.97, down from the 14.62 level.\n\n10) Long Build-up (44 Stocks)\n\nA long build-up was seen in 44 stocks.

        "text": "Trade setup for Monday: Top 15 things to know before the opening bell\nNifty Trade Setup\n\nThe market sentiment weakened further, with the Nifty 50 decisively breaking below the 100-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and falling below 24,200, resulting in nearly a percent loss. This led to the achievement of the first target of the Head and Shoulders pattern on October 25. Hence, experts foresee the index extending its southward journey to reach the August low of 23,894, followed by the 200-day EMA at 23,455 in the upcoming sessions. However, any rebound towards 25,650 (10-day EMA), given the RSI is in oversold territory, is expected to face selling pressure, and a \"sell on rally\" strategy is advised.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nHere are 15 data points we have collated to help you spot profitable trades:\n\n1) Key Levels For The Nifty 50\n\nResistance based on pivot points: 24,372, 24,458, and 24,598\n\nSupport based on pivot points: 24,092, 24,005, and 23,865\n\nSpecial Formation: The Nifty 50 formed a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, continuing the lower highs-lower lows formation for the fourth consecutive session amid above-average volumes. The index reached closer to the lower end of the Bollinger Band, and the 20-day EMA line fell below the 50-day EMA. The momentum oscillator RSI (Relative Strength Index) dropped below the 30 level, entering the oversold zone. On a weekly scale, the index shed 2.71 percent with a long bearish candle, continuing the formation of lower tops and bottoms for the fourth consecutive week, which is a negative sign.\n\n2) Key Levels For The Bank Nifty\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nResistance based on pivot points: 51,318, 51,582, and 52,009\n\nSupport based on pivot points: 50,463, 50,199, and 49,771\n\nResistance based on Fibonacci retracement: 51,348, 51,947\n\nSupport based on Fibonacci retracement: 50,272, 49,284\n\nSpecial Formation: The Bank Nifty formed a bearish candlestick pattern with a small lower shadow on the daily charts, falling 1.4 percent to close below 51,000 with above-average volumes. Like the Nifty 50, the Bank Nifty also fell below the 100-day EMA, further weakening market sentiment. While the index defended a rising support trendline, breaking it could drag the index down to the 200-day EMA. For the week, the index tanked 2.5 percent, forming a long bearish candle that resembles a Bearish Engulfing pattern on the weekly timeframe, and it decisively fell below short-term EMAs, which is also a negative sign.\n\n3) Nifty Call Options Data\n\nAccording to the monthly options data, the maximum open interest was seen at the 25,000 strike (with 1.08 crore contracts). This level can act as a key resistance level for the Nifty in the short term.

If the ratio falls below 0.7 or moves towards 0.5, then it indicates selling in Calls is higher than selling in Puts, reflecting a bearish mood in the market.\n\n9) India VIX\n\nVolatility spiked after a day of decline, keeping the bulls in a cautious mood. The India VIX, the fear indicator, rose 4.74 percent to a level of 14.63 on Friday, while for the week, the VIX jumped 12.23 percent.\n\n10) Long Build-up (14 Stocks)\n\nA long build-up was seen in 14 stocks.

The index formed a bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts but continued the trend of lower highs. Consolidation is likely to be seen in the upcoming sessions until the index gives a strong close above 25,500, with key support in the 24,750-24,700 zone. If the index sustains above 25,000, immediate resistance on the higher side is likely to be at 25,200-25,300.

        "text": "Trade setup for Thursday: Top 15 things to know before the opening bell\nNifty Trade Setup\n\nThe market faced selling pressure at higher levels and could not sustain intraday gains, with the Nifty 50 falling just below the 25,000 mark, posting moderate losses on October 9. The index negated the lower highs formation seen in the previous six trading sessions on the daily charts but maintained lower tops and bottoms on the weekly charts for another week. Therefore, if the index manages to sustain above the 25,300-25,350 zone, the trend may turn in favour of the bulls; until then, consolidation is likely, with support at 24,700, experts said.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nHere are 15 data points we have collated to help you spot profitable trades:\n\n1) Key Levels For The Nifty 50\n\nResistance based on pivot points: 25,164, 25,232, and 25,341\n\nSupport based on pivot points: 24,945, 24,878, and 24,768\n\nSpecial Formation: The benchmark Nifty 50 formed a small bearish candlestick pattern with a long upper shadow on the daily timeframe, indicating selling pressure at higher levels, although there was a higher high-higher low formation. The index sustained above the upward-sloping support trendline but still traded below the 50-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average), which is crucial for an upward rally.\n\n2) Key Levels For The Bank Nifty\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nResistance based on pivot points: 51,513, 51,702, and 52,009\n\nSupport based on pivot points: 50,899, 50,710, and 50,403\n\nResistance based on Fibonacci retracement: 51,826, 52,323\n\nSupport based on Fibonacci retracement: 50,681, 49,648\n\nSpecial Formation: The Bank Nifty also formed a small red candle with a long upper shadow on the daily charts, with above-average volumes during the weekly F&O expiry session, although it reported a higher top-bottom formation and closed moderately lower.

The maximum unwinding was seen at the 25,000 strike, which shed 4.61 lakh contracts, followed by the 24,800 and 24,900 strikes, which shed 3.54 lakh and 2.68 lakh contracts, respectively.\n\n4) Nifty Put Options Data\n\nOn the Put side, the 24,000 strike holds the maximum open interest (with 78.32 lakh contracts), which can act as a key support level for the Nifty. It was followed by the 24,500 strike (54.8 lakh contracts), and the 25,000 strike (46.3 lakh contracts).\n\nThe maximum Put writing was placed at the 24,400 strike, which saw an addition of 16.66 lakh contracts, followed by the 24,800 and 24,500 strikes, with 13.36 lakh and 13.13 lakh contracts added, respectively, while the Put unwinding was seen at the 25,500 strike, which shed 1.93 lakh contracts, followed by the 25,400, and 25,700 strikes, which shed 1.3 lakh and 1.12 lakh contracts, respectively.\n\n5) Bank Nifty Call Options Data\n\nAccording to the weekly options data, the maximum open interest was seen at the 51,000 strike, with 86.82 lakh contracts.

If the ratio falls below 0.7 or moves towards 0.5, then it indicates selling in Calls is higher than selling in Puts, reflecting a bearish mood in the market.\n\n9) India VIX\n\nVolatility extended its fall for another session but still held above the 14 mark. The bulls need to be cautious as long as it sustains above the 14 level. The India VIX, the fear index, fell by 3.19 percent to 14.12 levels.\n\n10) Long Build-up (47 Stocks)\n\nA long build-up was seen in 47 stocks.

A high share of delivery reflects investing (as opposed to trading) interest in a stock.\n\n15) Stocks Under F&O Ban\n\nSecurities banned under the F&O segment include companies where derivative contracts cross 95 percent of the market-wide position limit.\n\nStocks added to F&O ban: Tata Chemicals\n\nStocks retained in F&O ban: Bandhan Bank, Birlasoft, GNFC, Granules India, Hindustan Copper, IDFC First Bank, Manappuram Finance, Punjab National Bank, RBL Bank, SAIL\n\nStocks removed from F&O ban: Nil\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

It tested even the 20-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) as well as the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally (from 21,821 to 23,111) during the day but managed to defend both levels at close. Experts see some possibility of the index rebounding from these levels, as these generally act as key support areas, and may test the resistance of 22,700-22,800. However, if it fails, then 22,400 is the immediate support to watch, followed by 22,300. Considering the high volatility ahead of exit polls due on June 1 and Lok Sabha election results on June 4, experts advised participants to avoid making aggressive bets on either side in the initial days of the new series.\n\nThe Nifty 50 closed below 22,500 for the first time since May 17, declining 216 points or 0.95 percent to 22,489 with above-average volumes.

The Nifty 50 decisively fell below short-term moving averages and the support trendline, leading experts to believe that further correction can't be ruled out in the upcoming sessions. The 25,100-25,000 range is the crucial support area to watch on the downside, as falling below it could increase selling pressure. In the event of a rebound, the 25,400-25,500 range is likely to pose a hurdle.

Furthermore, the 5-day EMA has fallen below the 10-day EMA, while the momentum indicators RSI and MACD showed a negative bias, which is also a bearish sign.

According to experts, the index is likely to remain rangebound, with immediate support at 25,800 and resistance at 26,000, though the overall uptrend remains intact. Above 26,000, the next resistance is at 26,200, while below 25,800, crucial support is at 25,500.

This was followed by the 53,500 strike (28.3 lakh contracts) and the 54,000 strike (27.85 lakh contracts).\n\nThe maximum Put writing was observed at the 53,000 strike (which added 11.09 lakh contracts), followed by the 54,000 strike (6.61 lakh contracts) and the 53,700 strike (6.02 lakh contracts), while the maximum Put unwinding was seen at the 54,500 strike, which shed 44,550 contracts, followed by the 54,400 and 53,100 strikes which shed 7,890 and 4,740 contracts, respectively.\n\n7) Funds Flow (Rs crore)\n\n8) Put-Call Ratio\n\nThe Nifty Put-Call ratio (PCR), which indicates the mood of the market, dropped to 1.31 on September 24, from 1.42 levels in the previous session.\n\nThe increasing PCR, or being higher than 0.7 or surpassing 1, means traders are selling more Put options than Call options, which generally indicates the firming up of a bullish sentiment in the market. If the ratio falls below 0.7 or moves towards 0.5, then it indicates selling in Calls is higher than selling in Puts, reflecting a bearish mood in the market.\n\n9) India VIX\n\nVolatility failed to close above the 14 mark for another session, declining after a brief jump, which favours the bulls. Bulls may become cautious if volatility sustains above the 14 mark. The India VIX fell 2.85 percent, settling at 13.39 levels.\n\n10) Long Build-up (38 Stocks)\n\nA long build-up was seen in 38 stocks.

A high share of delivery reflects investing (as opposed to trading) interest in a stock.\n\n15) Stocks Under F&O Ban\n\nSecurities banned under the F&O segment include companies where derivative contracts cross 95 percent of the market-wide position limit.\n\nStocks added to F&O ban: Hindustan Copper, Indian Energy Exchange\n\nStocks retained in F&O ban: Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail, Granules India, Vodafone Idea\n\nStocks removed from F&O ban: Aarti Industries, Biocon, Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals, GNFC, LIC Housing Finance, NALCO, Oracle Financial Services Software, Punjab National Bank, SAIL\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

India VIX, the fear index, jumped 2.5 percent to 17.01 levels on Tuesday, and surged nearly 67 percent in the last nine consecutive sessions.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nOn May 7, the BSE Sensex fell 384 points to 73,512, while the Nifty 50 dropped 140 points to 22,303 and formed long bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with a minor lower shadow. This market action indicates an ongoing downward correction in the market.\n\n\"We observe overlapping negative candles on the downside in the last couple of sessions as per the daily chart which signals the absence of sharp selling momentum in the market,\" Nagaraj Shetti, senior technical research analyst at HDFC Securities said.\n\nThe lower tops and bottoms on the daily chart are intact and the present weakness could be in line with the new higher bottom formation of the pattern. The higher bottom reversal needs to be confirmed with an upside bounce from the lows.\n\n\"Immediate resistance is at 22,400 levels and the next lower levels are to be watched around 22,100-22,000,\" Nagaraj said.\n\nAccording to Rupak De, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities, further selling pressure is anticipated, possibly extending towards 21,980-22,000 in the short term, as long as it remains below 22,400.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nHere are 15 data points we have collated to help you spot profitable trades\n\nKey support and resistance levels on the Nifty and the Bank Nifty\n\nThe pivot point calculator indicates that the Nifty 50 is expected to face resistance at the 22,327 level, followed by 22,510 and 22,612 points.

The hurdle on the higher side for Nifty 50 is expected to be 22,800, and the support on the lower side is likely to be 22,500-22,400, which coincides with 10-day and 21-day EMAs (exponential moving average) respectively, hence the breaking of this range on either side can give firm direction to the index in coming days, experts said.\n\nOn May 2, the benchmark indices closed the rangebound session on a positive note. The BSE Sensex rose 128 points to 74,611, while the Nifty 50 climbed 43 points to 22,648 and formed bullish candlestick pattern with minor upper shadow on the daily charts.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\n\"This chart pattern indicates a rangebound action in the market near crucial resistance around 22,800 levels,\" said Nagaraj Shetti, senior technical research analyst at HDFC Securities. Similar range movements have been formed at the hurdle for few occasions in the past and that have eventually resulted in a short-term downward correction in the market.\n\nHe feels the short-term trend of Nifty is choppy with rangebound action. \"Any upside from here could encounter strong resistance around 22,800 levels. Immediate support is at 22,550 levels and a slide below the support could trigger some more weakness ahead,\" Nagaraj said.\n\nRupak De, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities, also feels, in the short term, the trend may continue sideways with potential to fluctuate within the range of 22,500-22,800.\n\nMeanwhile, volatility maintained upward journey and if it keeps increasing, then it may make the bulls uncomfortable in coming sessions.

        "text": "Trade setup for Wednesday: 15 things to know before opening bell\nStock Market Trend\n\nThe Nifty 50 lost ground in the last hour of trade amid consistent volatility, maintaining a downward move for the third consecutive session on May 28. The index failed to surpass 23,000 and closed just below 22,900. Market participants preferred to book profits, and bulls seem to be cautious given the rising volatility to a fresh two-year high. Even the chart formations indicated the exhaustion of bullish strength, which might attract a price-wise correction post-rally, experts believe. On the levels front, 23,000 is expected to be a crucial hurdle for the index as it needs to give a strong close above this level for a rally towards 23,100-23,200. Until then, consolidation may continue with immediate support at 22,800, and then 22,600 levels.\n\nThe Nifty 50 fell 44 points to 22,888 and formed a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, with a lower high-lower low formation. Meanwhile, the Bank Nifty saw a correction for the first time in the last four consecutive sessions, declining 140 points to 49,142 on profit booking. The index saw a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe, but experts feel overall, the trend remains in favour of bulls, and one should not be worried due to Tuesday's profit-taking, which was on expected lines after the recent rally.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nHere are 15 data points we have collated to help you spot profitable trades:\n\n1) Key Levels For The Nifty 50\n\nResistance based on pivot points: 22,969, 23,002, and 23,055\n\nSupport based on pivot points: 22,862, 22,829, and 22,775\n\nSpecial Formation: The index traded well above all key moving averages despite consolidation with a negative bias near the psychological 23,000 mark.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\n2) Key Levels For The Bank Nifty\n\nResistance based on pivot points: 49,411, 49,521, and 49,700\n\nSupport based on pivot points: 49,054, 48,943, and 48,765\n\nResistance based on Fibonacci retracement: 49,340, 49,975\n\nSupport based on Fibonacci retracement: 49,050, 48,658\n\nSpecial Formation: The Bank Nifty remained above the 49,000 mark, taking support at around 49,050 for another session.

Hence, the Nifty 50 may face hurdle at 22,200-22,300 on the higher side and if the index manages to decisively close above 22,300 then northward journey towards 22,500-22,600 is possible, with support at 22,000-21,900 levels, experts said.\n\nOn May 13, the benchmark indices extended uptrend for yet another session. The BSE Sensex was up 112 points at 72,776, while the Nifty 50 climbed 49 points to close at 22,104 after a 283-points recovery from the day's low.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\n\"On the higher side, band 22,300-22,320 could act as a resistance, while low of 21,821, registered on May 13 would remain support for the Nifty in the short term,\" Vinay Rajani, CMT, senior technical/derivative analyst at HDFC Securities said.\n\nAccording to Osho Krishan, senior analyst - technical & derivative research at Angel One, the formation of Hammer candlestick on the daily chart after a series of sell-offs is signaling a reversal pattern, but it would be early to claim, and a follow-up session is required to confirm the same.\n\nOn the level-specific front, he said a series of supports can be seen from 22,000-21,900, followed by the sacrosanct support of the 89 DEMA around 21,800 zone. On the higher end, \"22,200-22,300 is likely to act as intermediate resistance, and a sustainable surpass could only trigger a fresh round of longs in the system,\" he said.\n\nGoing ahead, Osho would likely to remain cautious amidst the rise in volatility, which may be deceptive and could trap traders on either side.\n\nThe India VIX, the fear gauge, more than doubled to 20.6 levels on May 13, from 10.2 on April 23, which indicates that the trend seems still in favour of bears and bulls are at uncomfortable position now.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nHere are 15 data points we have collated to help you spot profitable trades\n\nKey support and resistance levels on the Nifty and the Bank Nifty\n\nThe pivot point calculator indicates that the Nifty 50 may take immediate support at the 21,900 level, followed by 21,827 and 21,708 points.

We expect a relief rally in the Bank Nifty till 48,480 \u2013 48,500 from short term perspective,\" Jatin Gedia, technical research analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said.\n\nAccording to the pivot point calculator, the Bank Nifty index is likely to take support at 47,198, followed by 46,996 and 46,668. On the higher side, the index may see resistance at 47,854, followed by 48,057 and 48,385.\n\nCall options data\n\nAccording to the weekly options data, the maximum Call open interest remained at 23,000 strike, with 62.81 lakh contracts.

        "text": "Trade setup for Tuesday: 15 things to know before opening bell\nGiven the lack of earnings momentum in Q4FY24, Kotak analysts anticipate limited upgrades in earnings in the recent months\n\nThe market trend turned in favour of bears with consistently significantly rising volatility and the formation of yet another bearish candle on the daily charts. As long as the Nifty 50 holds 22,300, the low of the long bull candle of April 25, the consolidation may continue in the coming sessions with hurdles on the higher side at 22,600 levels, but the breaking of 22,300 can raise the chance of weakness in the short term, experts said.\n\nOn May 6, the BSE Sensex rose 17 points to 73,896, while the Nifty 50 fell 33 points to 22,443 and formed a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe besides a long bear candle, with lower highs formation.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nThis chart pattern indicates sell on rise opportunity amidst rangebound action, Nagaraj Shetti, senior technical research analyst at HDFC Securities said.\n\nHe further said having declined sharply from the new higher top of 22,794 levels last Friday, Nifty showing weakness down to a formation of a new higher bottom of the pattern, but still higher bottom reversal is not confirmed.\n\nHe feels the short-term trend of Nifty remains negative. \"As long as the support of 22,300 holds, there is a possibility of an upside bounce in the market. A move below the support could open more weakness in the short term.\"\n\nThe daily RSI (relative strength index) also indicates weakness and is skewed towards the lower end. Hence, \"key levels to watch include immediate support at 22,300 while resistance is placed at 22,550 followed by 22,600. Until the index attains 22,600, it would be better to employ a sell-on-rise strategy,\" Om Mehra, technical analyst at Samco Securities said.\n\nThe broader markets were also under pressure, with the Nifty Midcap 100 index falling half a percent and Smallcap 100 index declining 1.5 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, the volatility increased for the eighth consecutive session, putting the bulls in an uncomfortable position and favouring bears. India VIX, the fear index, jumped 13.56 percent to 16.6, the highest closing level since February 1, 2023, and surged nearly 63 percent in eight days.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nHere are 15 data points we have collated to help you spot profitable trades\n\nKey support and resistance levels on the Nifty and the Bank Nifty\n\nThe pivot point calculator indicates that the Nifty 50 is expected to face resistance at the 22,459 level, followed by 22,591 and 22,660 points. On the lower side, the index may take immediate support at the 22,412 level, followed by 22,369 and 22,301 points.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank Nifty has also seen rangebound trade and ended 28 points lower at 48,895, forming bearish candlestick pattern besides the previous long bear candle on the daily charts, but still holding above all key moving averages.\n\n\"Immediate resistance is noted at 49,300, and a decisive breakthrough could trigger short-covering moves towards 49,500. Conversely, a significant breach of the 48,900 mark may induce further selling pressure towards 48,400, where the 20DMA is positioned,\" Kunal Shah, senior technical & derivative analyst at LKP Securities said.\n\nAccording to the pivot point calculator, the Bank Nifty index may see resistance at 48,938, followed by 49,267 and 49,446. On the lower side, support is likely at 48,798, followed by 48,688 and 48,509.\n\nCall options data\n\nAccording to the weekly options data, the 23,000 strike owned the maximum Call open interest, with 91.56 lakh contracts. This level can act as a key resistance for the Nifty in the short term. It was followed by the 22,800 strike, which had 84.47 lakh contracts, while the 22,700 strike had 72.05 lakh contracts.\n\nMeaningful Call writing was seen at the 23,000 strike, which saw an addition of 27.67 lakh contracts. It was followed by 22,600 and 23,100 strikes that added 17.92 lakh and 17.68 lakh contracts.\n\nThe maximum Call unwinding was visible in the 23,400 strike, which shed 4.32 lakh contracts, followed by 23,600 and 22,000 strikes, which shed 1.14 lakh and 93,125 contracts, respectively.\n\nPut option data\n\nOn the Put side, the maximum open interest remained at 22,000 strike, which can act as a key support level for the Nifty with 62.45 lakh contracts. It was followed by the 22,500 strike, comprising 39.73 lakh contracts and then the 21,800 strike, with 39.15 lakh contracts.\n\nMeaningful Put writing was seen at the 21,700 strike, which saw an addition of 9.31 lakh contracts, followed by 22,400 and 22,300 strikes, with 8.85 lakh and 8.7 lakh contracts additions, respectively.\n\nPut unwinding was observed at the 22,700 strike, which shed 2.26 lakh contracts. This was followed by 21,000 and 21,200 strikes, with a reduction of 82,275 and 41,325 contracts, respectively.\n\nStocks with high delivery percentage\n\nA high delivery percentage reflects investor interest in a stock. ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company, JK Cement, Larsen & Toubro, Bharti Airtel, and Nestle India saw the highest delivery among the F&O stocks.\n\n28 stocks see long build-up\n\nA long build-up was seen in 28 stocks, including Britannia Industries, Gujarat Gas, Alkem Laboratories, Jubilant Foodworks, and Siemens. An increase in open interest (OI) and price indicates a build-up of long positions.\n\n60 stocks see long unwinding\n\nBased on the OI percentage, 60 stocks saw long unwinding, which included REC, Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals, BHEL, Dabur India, and Coal India. A decline in OI and price indicates long unwinding.\n\n65 stocks see a short build-up\n\nA short build-up was seen in 65 stocks, including Titan Company, Punjab National Bank, Coforge, Larsen & Toubro, and Bank of Baroda. An increase in OI, along with a fall in price, points to a build-up of short positions.\n\n33 stocks see short-covering\n\nBased on the OI percentage, 33 stocks were on the short-covering list including Godrej Properties, Zydus Lifesciences, Oracle Financial Services Software, Deepak Nitrite, and Havells India. A decrease in OI, along with a price increase, is an indication of short-covering.\n\nPut-Call Ratio\n\nThe Nifty Put-Call ratio (PCR), which indicates the mood of the market, dropped further to 0.85 on May 6, from 0.89 levels in the previous session.\n\nThe increasing PCR or higher than 0.7 or surpassing 1 means traders are selling more Put options than Calls options, which generally indicates the firming up of a bullish sentiment in the market. If the ratio falls below 0.7 or moves towards 0.5, then it indicates selling in Calls is higher than selling in Puts, reflecting a bearish mood in the market.\n\nBulk Deals\n\nFor more bulk deals, click here\n\nResults on May 7\n\nDr Reddy's Laboratories, PB Fintech, JSW Energy, Voltas, Delta Corp, Graphite India, Indraprastha Gas, IRB Infrastructure, Jindal Saw, KEC International, Max Financial Services, Navin Fluorine International, Pidilite Industries, Sonata Software, and United Breweries will release quarterly earnings on May 7.\n\nStocks in the news\n\nGodrej Consumer Products: The FMCG company has posted net loss at Rs 1,893.2 crore for quarter ended March FY24 despite healthy operating numbers, impacted by exceptional loss of Rs 2,375.65 crore for the quarter (against exceptional loss of Rs 22.2 crore in year-ago period).

The index is likely to march towards 22,500-22,600 area if it gives a strong close above 22,300 and manages to sustain above the same for few more days, while the 22,000 is going to be key support area and is unlikely to get broken in an immediate term, experts said.\n\nOn May 15, the BSE Sensex ended the volatile session on a negative note, falling 118 points to 72,987, while the Nifty 50 was down 17 points at 22,201 and formed bearish candlestick pattern with minor upper and lower shadows on the daily timeframe, indicating the choppy trade in the index. Both the indices had maintained upward journey in the previous three straight sessions.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\n\"One is required to have a pragmatic approach of the \u2018buy on dips\u2019 and \u2018sell on the rise\u2019 until we see a decisive participation of the bulls in carrying momentum,\" Osho Krishan, senior analyst - technical & derivative research at Angel One said.\n\nSimultaneously, he feels the resilience of 20 DEMA (days exponential moving average placed at 22,300) is expected to act as a daunting task for the bulls in the near period, and an authoritative breach could only dictate the next leg of rally in the index.\n\nOn the lower end of the spectrum, the support lies around 22,150-22,100, which is expected to cushion any intraday blips, followed by the sacrosanct support at 22,000 mark, he said.\n\nAccording to Jatin Gedia, technical research analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, the Nifty is in a pullback mode and has witnessed a brief pause around 22,308 levels where the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the recent fall is placed.\n\nHence, he believes that the pullback has more steam left and in case of a dip towards 22,130 \u2013 22,100 it should be used as a buying opportunity. On the upside immediate resistance is placed at 22,308 \u2013 22,422, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, on the broader markets front, the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices gained 1 percent and 0.6 percent respectively on positive breadth.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nHere are 15 data points we have collated to help you spot profitable trades\n\nKey support and resistance levels for the Nifty\n\nThe pivot point calculator indicates that the Nifty 50 is expected to face resistance at the 22,272 level, followed by 22,307 and 22,362 points. On the lower side, the index may take immediate support at the 22,161 level, followed by 22,127 and 22,071 points.\n\nKey support and resistance levels for the Bank Nifty\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank Nifty was also under pressure after uptrend in previous two trading sessions. The banking index was down 172 points at 47,687 and formed bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, but faced resistance at 48,000 mark for yet another day.\n\n\"To sustain the upward momentum, the index must decisively surpass this (48,000) mark, targeting levels around 48,500,\" Kunal Shah, senior technical & derivative analyst at LKP Securities said.\n\nOn the downside, he feels support is positioned at 47,200, presenting favorable buying opportunities on dips toward this level.\n\nAccording to the pivot point calculator, the Bank Nifty index may see resistance at 47,888, followed by 47,988 and 48,149.

If the ratio falls below 0.7 or moves towards 0.5, then it indicates selling in Calls is higher than selling in Puts, reflecting a bearish mood in the market.\n\nIndia VIX\n\nThe volatility remained hovering around 19 months high levels, putting the bulls at uncomfortable position and making the trend favourable for bears. India VIX, the fear gauge, rose by 0.38 percent to 20.27, from 20.20 levels. Unless and until it falls drastically in coming days, the stability and smooth ride for the Nifty is unlikely, experts said.\n\n36 stocks see long build-up\n\nA long build-up was seen in 36 stocks, including Metropolis Healthcare, BPCL, Alkem Laboratories, Dixon Technologies, and Cummins India. An increase in open interest (OI) and price indicates a build-up of long positions.\n\n47 stocks see long unwinding\n\nBased on the OI percentage, 47 stocks saw long unwinding, which included Shree Cement, JK Cement, Astral, Aarti Industries, and Escorts Kubota. A decline in OI and price indicates long unwinding.\n\n54 stocks see a short build-up\n\nA short build-up was seen in 54 stocks, including Granules India, PI Industries, Colgate Palmolive, Berger Paints, and Biocon. An increase in OI, along with a fall in price, points to a build-up of short positions.\n\n47 stocks see short-covering\n\nBased on the OI percentage, 47 stocks saw short-covering, which included Birlasoft, Siemens India, Persistent Systems, Canara Bank, and UPL. A decrease in OI, along with a price increase, is an indication of short-covering.\n\nStocks with high delivery percentage\n\nA high delivery percentage reflects investor interest in a stock. Apollo Hospitals Enterprises, Syngene International, Infosys, Dabur India, and LTIMindtree saw the highest delivery among the F&O stocks.\n\nStocks under F&O ban on NSE\n\nThe NSE has added Biocon, Granules India, India Cements, and LIC Housing Finance to the F&O ban list for May 16, while retaining Balrampur Chini Mills, Birlasoft, GMR Airports Infrastructure, Hindustan Copper, Vodafone Idea, Piramal Enterprises, SAIL, and Zee Entertainment Enterprises to the said list. Canara Bank was removed from the said list.\n\nSecurities banned under the F&O segment include companies where derivative contracts cross 95 percent of the market-wide position limit.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Market participants may be more cautious ahead of the expiry of May derivative contracts on Thursday, and the exit polls scheduled immediately after the seventh phase of the Lok Sabha election on June 1.\n\nAccording to experts, the next support for the index lies around 22,600, which coincides with the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level, followed by 22,500, coinciding with the 20-day SMA or the mid of the Bollinger Band. As long as the index holds these support lines, the possibility of a rebound seems high in the coming sessions, with crucial resistance at the 23,000 mark.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nThe Nifty 50 declined 183.5 points, or 0.80 percent, to close at 22,705, reporting a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with an upper shadow.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank Nifty also saw a gap-down opening and lost a further 641 points, or 1.3 percent, to 48,501, forming a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe. Experts expect the possibility of a bounce back in the index, as after the recent fall, it reached very close to the 20-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) as well as the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level placed around the 48,300 mark. However, if it fails to rebound, the correction may extend to the 48,000 mark.\n\nHere are 15 data points we have collated to help you spot profitable trades:\n\n1) Key Levels For The Nifty 50\n\nResistance based on pivot points: 22,792, 22,825, and 22,879\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nSupport based on pivot points: 22,685, 22,652, and 22,598\n\nSpecial Formation: The Nifty 50 continued the lower highs-lower lows formation for the second consecutive session, with the momentum indicator Relative Strength Index (RSI) showing a negative crossover on the daily as well as weekly charts. Despite this, the index still held above all key moving averages.\n\n2) Key Levels For The Bank Nifty\n\nResistance based on pivot points: 48,879, 49,026, and 49,263\n\nSupport based on pivot points: 48,405, 48,258, and 48,021\n\nResistance based on Fibonacci retracement: 49,332, 49,975\n\nSupport based on Fibonacci retracement: 48,332, 48,018\n\nSpecial Formation: The Bank Nifty also formed a lower highs-lower lows formation for two days in a row, with the RSI giving a negative crossover on the daily as well as weekly timeframe. However, it defended the 20-day EMA (48,389) on a closing basis.\n\n3) Nifty Call Options Data\n\nAccording to the monthly options data, the maximum Call open interest was seen at 23,500 strike. This level can act as a key resistance level for the Nifty in the short term. It was followed by the 23,000 strike and the 24,000 strike.\n\nMaximum Call writing was observed at the 22,800 strike, followed by the 22,900 and 23,000 strikes, while the maximum Call unwinding was visible at the 23,800 strike, followed by the 23,700 and 24,000 strikes.\n\n4) Nifty Put Options Data\n\nOn the Put side, the 22,000 strike holds the maximum open interest, which can act as a key support level for the Nifty.

This can act as a crucial level for the index in the short term. It was followed by the 48,600 strike and the 48,700 strike.\n\nMaximum Call writing was visible at the 48,500 strike, followed by the 48,600 and 48,700 strikes, while the maximum Call unwinding was observed at the 49,500 strike, followed by the 49,300 and 48,000 strikes.\n\n6) Bank Nifty Put Options Data\n\nOn the Put side, the 48,500 strike holds the maximum open interest, which can act as a crucial level for the index.

If the ratio falls below 0.7 or moves towards 0.5, then it indicates selling in Calls is higher than selling in Puts, reflecting a bearish mood in the market.\n\n9) India VIX\n\nVolatility sustained above the 24 mark for another session on Wednesday and is likely to remain elevated in the coming sessions. The market may not achieve stability until it experiences a sharp fall. The India VIX declined 0.08 percent to 24.18, from 24.20 levels.\n\n10) Long Build-up (23 Stocks)\n\nA long build-up was seen in 23 stocks, including Gujarat Gas, L&T Technology Services, Cummins India, AU Small Finance Bank, and Dixon Technologies. An increase in open interest (OI) and price indicates a build-up of long positions.\n\n11) Long Unwinding (80 Stocks)\n\n80 stocks saw a decline in open interest (OI) along with a fall in price, indicating long unwinding.\n\n12) Short Build-up (51 Stocks)\n\n51 stocks saw an increase in OI along with a fall in price, indicating a build-up of short positions.\n\n13) Short-Covering (32 Stocks)\n\n32 stocks saw short-covering, meaning a decrease in OI, along with a price increase.\n\n14) High Delivery Trades\n\nHere are the stocks that saw a high share of delivery trades.

As long as the Nifty holds 21,900, the low of long bearish candle of May 9 and which also coincides with the rising support trendline, the consolidation is expected to continue and the index may face resistance at 22,200-22,300 levels, but the breaking of 21,900 can drag it towards 21,775, the low of April month, experts said.\n\nOn May 10, the BSE Sensex climbed 260 points to 72,665, while the Nifty 50 rose 98 points to 22,055 and formed small bullish candlestick pattern with minor upper and lower shadow on the daily charts.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nTechnically, this pattern indicates temporary pause in the market after a sharp decline. Nifty placed at the crucial trendline support around 21,900 and still there is no indication of any higher bottom reversal pattern forming at the lows, Nagaraj Shetti, senior technical research analyst at HDFC Securities said.\n\nNifty on the weekly chart formed a long bearish candle with minor lower shadow. After the formation of Long Legged Doji at new highs in the previous week, Nifty forming a long bear candle during the last week indicates negative bias.\n\nShetti feels having placed at the key trendline support, there is a possibility of minor upside bounce in the short term, but the market could eventually break down the present support of 21,900-21,850 levels and could slide down to 22,700-22,600 in the near term. \"Immediate resistance is at 22,300 levels.\"\n\nJigar S Patel, senior manager - equity research at Anand Rathi, also feels the index is nearing the lower boundary of an upward channel, and breaching the same could signal deeper market concerns. \"Looking ahead, a drop below 21,900, the previous swing low of 21,777, may induce market panic,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the elevated volatility also seems to be keeping the bears in action against bulls. India VIX, the fear gauge, rallied 81 percent in the past 12 consecutive sessions, to 18.47 levels, the highest closing level since October 13, 2022.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nHere are 15 data points we have collated to help you spot profitable trades\n\nKey support and resistance levels on the Nifty and the Bank Nifty\n\nThe pivot point calculator indicates that the Nifty 50 may take immediate support at the 21,976 level, followed by 21,934 and 21,865 points. On the higher side, the index is expected to face resistance at the 22,072 level, followed by 22,157 and 22,227 points.\n\nMeanwhile, the banking index tried to claw back, but failed to hold on to those gains and finally settled 67 points lower at 47,421, continuing weakness for eighth straight session. The index has formed small negative candle with long upper shadow on the daily charts, indicating selling pressure at higher levels, but considering it is near the middle of Bollinger band, the pull back rally can't be ruled out in coming days, experts said.\n\n\"The Bank Nifty is approaching the 20-week moving average placed at 47,240 and thus a sharp decline from current levels appears unlikely,\" Jatin Gedia, technical research analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said.\n\nHence, he expects a relief rally during the next week.\n\nAccording to the pivot point calculator, the Bank Nifty index is likely to take support at 47,322, followed by 47,191 and 46,979. On the higher side, the index may see resistance at 47,472, followed by 47,878 and 48,090.\n\nCall options data\n\nAccording to the weekly options data, the 23,000 strike owned the maximum Call open interest, with 68.44 lakh contracts. This level can act as a key resistance for the Nifty in the short term.

The Nifty 50 sustained an uptrend for five days in a row and reached near the critical hurdle of 22,600, despite a correction in the Bank Nifty. Furthermore, the index continued to see higher highs formation while trading above all key moving averages, as well as maintaining a positive bias in the momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index placed at 59.12). Hence, the trend remains positive. Experts feel that if the index closes and holds above 22,600 in the coming sessions, then the index's journey towards 22,800 can't be ruled out. Till then, it may consolidate with support at 22,500-22,400 levels.\n\nThe Nifty 50 climbed 69 points or 0.51 percent to 22,598 on Wednesday and formed a bullish candlestick pattern with a long lower shadow on the daily charts, indicating support-based buying interest.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank Nifty extended its correction for the second consecutive session and formed a bearish candlestick pattern with a long lower shadow on the daily timeframe.

If the ratio falls below 0.7 or moves towards 0.5, then it indicates selling in Calls is higher than selling in Puts, reflecting a bearish mood in the market.\n\n9) India VIX\n\nThe volatility has gradually been increasing as the market approaches the general election results due on June 4. This may make the bulls cautious at higher levels. The India VIX, the fear index, rose by 6.26 percent to 21.81, the highest closing level since September 28, 2022.\n\n10) Long Build-up (57 Stocks)\n\nA long build-up was observed in 57 stocks, including Coal India, Indian Energy Exchange, Metropolis Healthcare, BHEL, and Hindustan Aeronautics.

        "text": "Trade setup for Thursday: 15 things to know before opening bell\nMarket Trend\n\nThe market took a U-turn from its lifetime highs on April 30 as participants seemed to have turned cautious ahead of the outcome of US Federal Reserve meeting and a mid-week holiday. But overall, the sentiment remains positive as the index traded above all key moving averages, and as long as the Nifty 50 holds key support of 22,300, the upward rally towards 23,000 may resume once again after likely consolidation in immediate term, experts said.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve maintained interest rates steady at 5.25-5.50 percent on May 1 and signaled it is still leaning towards eventual reductions in borrowing cost.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nAccording to experts, the consolidation, if any, in immediate term, will be on expected lines especially after hitting a new high, and if the index breaks 22,300, then selling pressure may extend towards 22,000 level.\n\nOn April 30, the BSE Sensex fell 189 points to 74,483, while the Nifty 50 shed 180 points from its record high and ended with 39 points losses at 22,605 and formed bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts. The index opened strong and rallied 140 points before turning lower in the last hour.\n\nThe market was shut on May 1 for Maharashtra day.\n\n\"From a technical standpoint, the Nifty index looks subtle, hovering above its 20 DEMA and nothing significant has changed on the levels front from the previous session. Therefore, traders are advised to maintain a positive stance and view dips as potential buying opportunities, instilling a sense of optimism,\" Osho Krishan, senior analyst - technical & derivative research at Angel One said.\n\nIn this scenario, he feels immediate support is likely to shift higher towards the 22,500 mark, followed by 22,400, coinciding with 20 DEMA. On the contrary, the lifetime high zone around 22,775 - 22,800 is expected to serve as immediate resistance before the index heads toward the 23,000 mark, he said.\n\nSignificant Call writing was observed at the 22,800 strike in the Nifty 50. The Put writers cut their exposure at the 22,700 strike towards the last hour of the day which led the down move in Nifty.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nThe option activity at the 22,800 strike will provide cues about Nifty\u2019s direction ahead of the weekly expiry on Thursday, May 2, said Ashwin Ramani, derivatives & technical analyst at Samco Securities.\n\nMeanwhile, the volatility, which surged significantly in the past five sessions, also seems to have put the bulls at uncomfortable positions. The India VIX, the fear index, jumped 5.2 percent to 12.87 levels on April 30, and jumped 26 percent in last five consecutive sessions.\n\nHere are 15 data points we have collated to help you spot profitable trades\n\nKey support and resistance levels on the Nifty and the Bank Nifty\n\nThe pivot point calculator indicates that the Nifty 50 is expected to face resistance at the 22,734 level, followed by 22,785 and 22,867 points. On the lower side, the index may take immediate support at the 22,570 level, followed by 22,519 and 22,437 points.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank Nifty also saw a similar kind of trend after reaching closer to 50,000 mark on April 30, and lost 578 points from record high levels to end 27 points down at 49,397. The index has formed small-bodied bearish candlestick pattern with long upper shadow on the daily timeframe, indicating profit booking at higher levels.\n\nUnderperformance by heavyweights like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank dragged down the index. \"The primary trend remains positive until the 48,600 level is not violated. In the short term, dips in the index should be viewed as buying opportunities,\" Om Mehra, technical analyst at Samco Securities said.\n\nAccording to the pivot point calculator, the Bank Nifty index may see resistance at 49,817, followed by 49,988 and 50,265. On the lower side, support is likely at 49,264, followed by 49,093 and 48,816.\n\nCall options data\n\nAccording to the weekly options data, the 23,000 strike owned the maximum Call open interest, with 1 crore contracts. This level can act as a key resistance for the Nifty in the short term. It was followed by the 22,800 strike, which had 78.08 lakh contracts, while the 22,900 strike had 59.71 lakh contracts.\n\nMeaningful Call writing was seen at the 22,800 strike, which saw an addition of 26.54 lakh contracts.

It was followed by the 22,500 strike, comprising 70.2 lakh contracts and then the 22,400 strike, with 56.93 lakh contracts.\n\nMeaningful Put writing was seen at the 22,700 strike, which saw an addition of 15.19 lakh contracts, followed by 22,000 and 22,200 strikes, with 14.98 lakh and 12.58 lakh contracts additions, respectively.\n\nPut unwinding was observed at the 21,500 strike, which shed 17.91 lakh contracts. This was followed by 21,700 and 22,500 strikes, with deduction of 15.84 lakh and 8.44 lakh contracts, respectively.\n\nStocks with high delivery percentage\n\nA high delivery percentage reflects investor interest in a stock.
