        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to Sensex. Five stocks to buy or sell in Muhurat trading\nStock market today: Following weak global market sentiments, the Indian stock market ended lower for the second straight session on Thursday. The Nifty 50 index lost 135 points and closed at 24,205, the BSE Sensex corrected 553 points and ended at 79,389, and the Nifty Bank index finished 251 points lower at 51,555. Cash market volumes have remained steady over the last few days, suggesting no great conviction on either side by participants. The small-cap index ended 1.6 per cent positive even as the advance-decline ratio remained firm at 1.82:1.\n\nGlobal shares mostly declined on Thursday as investors grappled with uncertainty ahead of the US elections next Tuesday. Sentiments soured after Facebook owner Meta Platforms, and Microsoft warned of accelerating artificial intelligence costs. Europe's benchmark index fell on Thursday, headed for its worst monthly performance in a year.\n\nTrade setup for Muhurat Trading 2024 Speaking on the outlook for Nifty today, Rajesh Bhosale, Equity Technical Analyst at Angel One, said, \"As October concluded, it marked a challenging month for bulls, erasing gains accumulated over the past two months, with Nifty dropping more than 6% one of the steepest monthly declines in recent times, which has impacted the monthly chart's structure. Throughout the week, the 24,100 to 24,000 zone provided some support due to oversold conditions, but the index faced persistent resistance on attempted rebounds. Despite multiple efforts, prices couldn't surpass the 24500 level, part of a resistance zone around 24500\u201324600, created by a confluence of key moving averages. A strong close above this range is needed before considering aggressive positions, as the market seems poised for a phase of high volatility. Conversely, a breach below this week's support range of 24100\u201324000 could trigger further weakness, possibly pulling prices toward the 200 SMA near 23,500.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"Bank Nifty opened with a gap-down and faced pressure throughout, closing at 51,475. A red candle on the daily scale suggests continued weakness, with the 100-Days Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) at 51,150, providing short-term support, followed by 51,000 levels. Thus, 51,000-51,150 will provide short-term support for the index, while resistance stands near the previous swing high at 52,580. In the immediate term, Bank Nifty is expected to consolidate between 51,000 and 52,580. Either side's breakout will set up the index's next move.\"\n\nSpeaking on the outlook for the Indian stock market today and triggers that may dictate Dalal Street during Muhurat Trading 2024, Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal said, \"We expect this range-bound move to continue with an increase in volatility as we enter an eventful week. Investor's focus would remain on the ongoing result season as several index heavy-weights like Titan, Dr Reddy's, Tata Steel, Power Grid, Apollo Hospital, M&M, Trent, SBI, Tata Motors, Asian Paint, Divis Labs are set to announce their quarterly results next week. Globally, US presidential polls will be conducted on November 5th, followed by US Fed and BOE interest rate decisions, which will keep investors busy.\"\n\nStocks to buy today Regarding shares to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended buying these five shares: Crisil, Fortis Healthcare, Natco Pharma, Chambal Fertilisers, and Sun Pharma.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stock recommendations today 1] Crisil: Buy at \u20b95474.75, target \u20b95850, stop loss \u20b95280.\n\nCRISIL's daily chart analysis offers a favourable view for the following week, indicating a steady upward advance. Notably, the stock has produced a notable higher high and higher low pattern in the daily frame, and the company's recent upward swing has effectively violated the neckline, establishing a new week high. This breakthrough indicates the possibility of a significant follow-through upward increase in the stock price.\n\n2] Fortis Healthcare: Buy at \u20b9624.70, target \u20b9665, stop loss \u20b9600.\n\nFORTIS currently trades at \u20b9642.7 and demonstrates a strong uptrend, characterized by higher highs and higher lows, reflecting a bullish sentiment. The stock has recently broken out of a sideways continuation pattern, indicating the potential for further upside. It has rebounded significantly from its 50-day EMA level, a medium-term indicator supporting the likelihood of continued momentum. Should the stock close above its recent highs, it could unlock further gains, with a short-term target of \u20b9665.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today 3] Natco Pharma: Buy at \u20b91402, target \u20b91450, stop loss \u20b91365.\n\nThe stock has substantial support at \u20b91365, marking a crucial juncture in its recent trading. At \u20b91402, the stock has demonstrated a definitive reversal in price action, suggesting a potential continuation of its upward momentum. Traders keen on seizing this opportunity could consider buying and holding the stock, setting a prudent stop loss at \u20b91365. The anticipated target for this trade is \u20b91450, representing the next significant resistance level. This strategy positions traders favourably to capitalize on the stock's expected rally in the weeks ahead.\n\n4] Chambal Fertilizers: Buy at \u20b9484, target \u20b9498, stop loss \u20b9475.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis. This technical pattern suggests a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around \u20b9498. The stock is currently maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b9475. Given the current market price of \u20b9484, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b9498.\n\n5] Sun Pharma: Buy at \u20b91858, target \u20b91900, stop loss \u20b91840.\n\nOn the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the \u20b91858 price level has been observed, signalling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss of \u20b91840 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b91900 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to Q2 results; five stocks to buy on Wednesday \u2014 October 16\nStock Market Today: The benchmark Nifty50 index continuing its correction phase ended at 25,057.35, 0.28% lower on Tuesday. S&P BSE Sensex also ended a volatile trading session at 81,820.12 down 0.19%. Bank Nifty at 51,906.00 ended 0.17% higher. Realty was major gainers supported by FMCG though auto and metals were among losers. The broader markets however outperformed with mid and small caps gaining.\n\nTrade setup for Wednesday Nifty slipped into weakness on October 15 and formed a reasonable bear candle, said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities Nifty remains choppy even as the 25200 level proves difficult to breach on the upside. Nifty could stay in the 25234-24832 band for the near term, added Jasani.\n\nBank Nifty with the help of ICICI bank managed to close with gains and above the 40-day average (51,872). Positive momentum is likely to continue towards 52,500 which coincides with the 20-day average. Support base shifts higher towards 51,400 \u2013 51,500, said Jatin Gedia \u2013 Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan\n\nGlobal market outlook Asian shares were mixed on Tuesday and Chinese stocks tumbled. European shares were little changed on Tuesday as oil prices dropped on a report that Israel will refrain from striking Iranian energy targets.\n\nBroking stocks were in momentum after Angel One reported a strong set of numbers though weak results by index heavyweights by Reliance dented the sentiment. Overall, we expect markets to consolidate in the near term in the absence of any major triggers. Although Q2 results would continue to provide stock-specific action, said Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services\n\nStocks to buy today Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, has recommended two stock picks for Tuesday.

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to Q2 results 2024; five stocks to buy or sell on Tuesday \u2014 October 15\nStock Market Today: The Nifty 50 index ended with gains of 0.66% at 25,127.95 on Monday, as some decline in crude prices provided a relief even though uncertainties pertaining to the Iran-Israel war and FII outflows persist. BSE Sensex closed at 81,973.05, a gain of 0.73%.\n\nThe Bank Nifty at 51,816.90, ended higher by more than 1%, while realty and IT stocks also saw decent gains. Metals and energy sectors, however, remained subdued. The broader markets gained.\n\nTrade setup for Tuesday Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research, Kotak Securities, said that as long as the Nifty and Sensex are trading above 25,000 and 81,500, the pullback formation is likely to continue and could move up to 25,200-25,260 and 82,300-82,500, respectively. On the flip side, below 25,000 and 81,500, the sentiment could change, he added.\n\nBank Nifty could test levels of 52,500\u201352,800 in the short term. On the downside, 51,000 will provide strong support for Bank Nifty. Thus, as long as the index holds above 51,000, a \"buy on dips\" strategy should be pursued, advised Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C. Mehta Investment Interrmediates.\n\nAlso Read | Chandan Taparia recommends three stocks to buy today - October 15\n\nGlobal market outlook Asian shares gained ground on Monday, with stocks in China rising more than 2% on expectations of more stimulus. European stocks were mixed.\n\n\u201cGlobal markets are showing mixed signals as China\u2019s disinflation and weaker economic data suggest a potential further slowdown in global economic growth, already affected by rising geopolitical tensions,\u201d said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. Furthermore, the positive impact of the Chinese stimulus package seems to be diminishing.\n\nThe Indian market is demonstrating resilience, with subdued Q2 earnings expectations seemingly priced in and oil prices declining. The IT and financial sectors are attracting buying interest after recent corrections, said Nair.\n\nMeanwhile, traders will react to the results of heavyweights like Reliance and HCL Technologies in early Tuesday trades.\n\nStocks to buy today Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, has recommended two stock picks for Tuesday. Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi has suggested three stock ideas for today.\n\nThese include Torrent Power, NMDC, REC Ltd, Ambuja Cements and Titan Company.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1.Torrent Power Ltd- Bagadia recommends buying Torrent Power at \u20b91,940.25, keeping a stop loss at \u20b91,872 with a target price of \u20b92,076.\n\nTorrent Power is currently trading at \u20b91,940.25. The stock has recently rebounded from a key support zone and is on the verge of a breakout from its consolidation range, confirming upward momentum. This breakout is supported by a significant increase in trading volumes, signalling strong buying interest from investors. In the short term, the stock appears poised to target \u20b92,076, Bagadi said.\n\n2. NMDC Ltd- Bagadia recommends buying NMDC Ltd at \u20b9237.05, keeping a stop loss at \u20b9229 with a target price of \u20b9254.\n\nNMDC is currently trading at \u20b9237.05 and has shown a strong rebound from the support zone of \u20b9220, forming a bullish candle on the daily chart. This indicates the formation of a bullish reversal pattern, with increasing trading volumes further confirming a positive outlook. If the stock sustains above the critical level of \u20b9240, it is likely to continue its upward momentum towards the target price of \u20b9254.\n\nGanesh Dongre's stocks to buy today 3. REC Ltd - Dongre recommends buying REC at \u20b9540, keeping a stoploss at \u20b9528 for a target price of \u20b9555.\n\nThe stock has substantial support at \u20b9528, marking a crucial juncture in its recent trading. Presently, at \u20b9540, the stock has demonstrated a definitive reversal in price action, suggesting a potential continuation of its upward momentum. Traders keen on seizing this opportunity could consider buying and holding the stock, setting a prudent stop loss at \u20b9528. The anticipated target for this trade is \u20b9555, representing the next significant resistance level. This strategy positions traders favourably to capitalise on the stock's anticipated rally in the weeks ahead.\n\n4. Ambuja Cements Ltd - Dongre recommends buying Ambuja Cements at \u20b9589, keeping a stop loss at \u20b9575 for a target price of \u20b9615.\n\nIn the recent short-term trend analysis of the stock, a notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged. This technical pattern suggests the possibility of a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around \u20b9615. At present, the stock is maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b9575. Given the current market price of \u20b9589, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors might consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b9615.\n\n5. Titan Company Ltd - Dongre recommends buying Titan Company at \u20b93,500, keeping a stop loss at \u20b93,400 for a target price of \u20b93,650.\n\nOn the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the \u20b93,500 price level has been observed, signalling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss of \u20b93,400 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b93,650 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory, Dongre said.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to Q2 results 2024; five stocks to buy or sell on Monday \u2014 Oct 14\nStock Market Today: The benchmark Nifty 50 Index consolidated last week to end 0.2% lower. Industrials, Healthcare, and Auto remained among the top-performing sectors while Metal & FMCG were the top underperformers. Bank Nifty ended the week at 51,172.30, marginally lower over the previous week.\n\nTrade setup for Monday Nifty's bias is expected to remain negative unless it decisively reclaims the 25,300 level, representing its 20-day exponential moving average (DEMA), said Ajit Mishra \u2013 SVP, Research, Religare Broking Ltd. On the downside, immediate support is seen at 24,700, with major support at 24,400, the 100-day exponential average, as per Mishra.\n\nNifty Bank index would have important near-term support at around 50,000 levels while on the upside, it needs to breach the 51,800 level decisively to establish some conviction, said Vaishali Parekh Vice President - Technical Research, Prabhudas Lilladher.\n\nGlobal market outlook In spite of mixed global cues, US markets remain firm and continue rising. This optimism hasn't yet permeated to Indian markets. Metal stocks might continue to be supported by expectations of additional stimulus policies from China, analysts said.\n\nQ2 results 2024 Corporate results will likely influence the market as Reliance, HDFC Life, Axis Bank, Wipro & LTIMindtree are slated to post their Q2 earnings this week. After a sharp fall the week before last, Nifty consolidated for the week ending October 11 and traded sideways amid relentless selling by FIIs and the absence of any major triggers. \u201cWe expect markets to consolidate at higher zones and take cues from global factors & result season,\u201d said Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.\n\nStocks to buy today Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, has recommended two stock picks for Monday.

If the stock manages to close above its key resistance level of \u20b9870, then it can achieve a short-term target of \u20b9915.\n\n2. Mankind Pharma Ltd- Bagadia recommends buying Mankind Pharma at \u20b92,792.55 with a stop loss of \u20b92,690 for a target price of \u20b92,950.\n\nMankind has recently experienced a significant breakthrough above the crucial resistance zone ranging from 2,650 to 2,727 on the daily chart.

Piramal Enterprises Ltd - Dongre recommends buying Piramal Enterprises at \u20b91,080 with a stop loss of \u20b91,050 and a target of \u20b91,140.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis.

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to global markets; five stocks to buy or sell on Friday \u2014 Oct 11\nStock Market Today: The Nifty 50 index, continuing its consolidation phase, ended with a marginal gain of 0.07% at 24,998.45 on Thursday, October 10. The S&P BSE Sensex also ended with 0.18% gains at 81,611.41.\n\nThe Bank Nifty rose 1.07% to 51,530.90 and was well supported by the metal and energy sectors. However, pharma and IT saw sharp declines. Broader indices failed to build on early momentum and closed on a mixed note.\n\nTrade setup for Friday The current market texture is non-directional, said Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research, Kotak Securities, who feels 25,130 for Nifty and 82,000 for Sensex would be the key breakout levels. Above the same, the market could bounce back to 25,260-25,300 levels for the Nifty and 82,300-82,500 levels for the Sensex.\n\nBank Nifty witnessed a pullback to the key hourly moving averages (51,700 \u2013 51,800). Jatin Gedia \u2013 Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan expects the pullback to continue on the upside and towards 52,000 \u2013 52,400.\n\nGlobal market amidst Iran-Israel war Asian equities mostly rose on Friday triggered by overnight gains in the US stocks. European shares slipped on Thursday, with technology and mining stocks leading losses, as investors awaited the US inflation data which along with initial jobless claims numbers is expected to decide the course to be taken by the US Federal Reserve regarding its future monetary policy.\n\nSiddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd expects the market to consolidate in a range with stock-specific action.\n\nStocks to buy today Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, has recommended two stock picks for Friday. Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi has suggested three stock ideas for today.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1. Apar Industries Ltd - Bagadia recommends buying Apar Industries at \u20b910,649.7, keeping a stop loss at \u20b910,250 for a target price of \u20b911,350.\n\nApar Industries is currently trading at 10,649.7 and remains in an uptrend, as observed by the series of higher highs and higher lows formed over time. The stock has recently touched an all-time high of 10,720, indicating it is still in an uptrend, supported by a significant increase in volume. If the stock manages to close above its key resistance level of 10,700, it could reach a short-term target of 11,350.\n\n2. Gujarat Fluorochemicals Ltd - Bagadia recommends buying Gujarat Fluorochemicals at \u20b94,659.75 keeping a stop loss at \u20b94,488 for a target price of \u20b94,900.\n\nGujarat Fluorochemicals is presently trading at 4,659.75 levels. On the daily chart, the stock has formed a strong bullish momentum candle, signifying a resurgence of strength in its price action. A robust support level is situated at 4,488 levels. This confluence of support factors enhances the stock's stability and resilience.\n\nGanesh Dongre's stocks to buy today 3. Clean Science and Technology Ltd - Dongre recommends buying Clean Science and Technology at \u20b91,520 with a stop loss of \u20b91,485 for a target price of \u20b91,595.\n\nThe stock has substantial support at \u20b91,485, marking a crucial juncture in its recent trading. Presently, at Rs1,520, the stock has demonstrated a definitive reversal in price action, suggesting a potential continuation of its upward momentum. Traders keen on seizing this opportunity could consider buying and holding the stock, setting a prudent stop loss at \u20b91,485. The anticipated target for this trade is \u20b91,595, representing the next significant resistance level. This strategy positions traders favourably to capitalise on the stock's anticipated rally in the weeks ahead.\n\n4. GAIL (India) Ltd - Dongre recommends buying GAIL at \u20b9226 with a stop loss at \u20b9218 for a target of \u20b9235.\n\nIn the recent short-term trend analysis of the stock, a notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged. This technical pattern suggests the possibility of a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around \u20b9235. At present, the stock is maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b9218. Given the current market price of \u20b9226, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors might consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b9235.\n\n5 Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd - Dongre recommends buying Mahindra & Mahindra at \u20b93,200 with a stop loss of \u20b93,140 and a target price of \u20b93,330.\n\nOn the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the \u20b93,200 price level has been observed, signalling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss at \u20b93,140 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b93,330 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to global outlook amid Iran-Israel war; five stocks to buy or sell \u2014 Oct 10\nStock Market Today: The Nifty 50 index continued its correction phase after a one-day gap on Wednesday, ending the volatile trading session at 24,981.95, down 0.12%. The S&P BSE Sensex settled at 81,467.10, also 0.21% lower. The sectoral indices were a mixed bag, as realty and pharma gained while FMCG and energy sectors saw declines. While the Bank Nifty gained intraday post the RBI MPC outcome, it ended 0.03% lower at 51,007. Broader indices, however, surprised with outperformance, gaining over 1%.\n\nTrade setup for Thursday Nifty ended lower, wiping all gains during the day as the bulls ran into resistance and profit-taking at 25200+ levels, said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities. Nifty could now stay in the 24,832-25,230 band for the near term and a breach of either value could mean acceleration in that direction, added Jasani\n\n\"Technically, as long as the Nifty Bank index holds above 50,190, a \"buy on dips\" strategy is advisable. On the upside, the 51,700\u201351,800 range will act as a short-term hurdle for Bank Nifty,\" said Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C. Mehta Investment Intermediates Ltd.\n\nGlobal market amidst Iran-Israel war Most stocks in the Asia-Pacific region were also mixed. Chinese markets fell sharply as stimulus measures seemed inadequate. Investors are watchful on reports that Alphabet Inc., the company that owns Google, may face antitrust charges from US authorities, and indications that the Federal Reserve will gradually reduce interest rates is impacting sentiments.\n\nWith ongoing tensions in the Middle East affecting oil prices and anticipation surrounding domestic quarterly earnings, market participants are keen to see how these factors will influence performance in the coming days, said Vikram Kasat, Head - Advisory, Prabhudas Lilladher.\n\nStocks to buy today Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, has recommended two stock picks for Thursday. Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi has suggested three stock ideas for today.\n\nThese include Prestige Estates Projects, Marksans Pharma, NMDC, JSW Steel and Ashok Leyland.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1. Prestige Estates Projects Ltd - Bagadia recommends buying Prestige Estates Projects at \u20b91,858.2 with a stop loss at \u20b91,793 for a target price of \u20b91,988.\n\nPrestige is currently trading at \u20b91858.2, forming a strong bullish candle on the daily chart, which indicates a potential reversal from key support levels. The stock has rebounded from its support zone, suggesting a reversal pattern, and the increase in trading volumes further confirms a bullish outlook. If Prestige sustains above the crucial level of \u20b91900, it is likely to continue its upward momentum towards the target price of \u20b91988.\n\n2. Marksans Pharma Ltd - Bagadia recommends buying Marksans Pharma at \u20b9297.05, keeping a stop loss at \u20b9287 for a target price of \u20b9318.\n\nMarksans is currently trading at \u20b9297.05, exhibiting a strong bullish trend. The stock has recently broken out from a falling trendline and has shown a significant bullish reversal from a support zone, accompanied by a notable surge in trading volumes. This reflects strong buying interest from investors. In the short term, Marksans is poised to reach a target of \u20b9318.\n\nGanesh Dongre's stocks to buy today 3. NMDC Ltd - Dongre recommends buying NMDC at \u20b9224, keeping a stop loss of \u20b9218 for a target price of \u20b9235.\n\nIn the recent short-term trend analysis of the stock, a notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged. This technical pattern suggests the possibility of a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around \u20b9235. At present, the stock is maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b9218. Given the current market price of \u20b9224, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors might consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b9235.\n\n4. JSW Steel Ltd - Dongre recommends buying JSW Steel at \u20b9995, keeping a stop loss at \u20b9980 for a target price of \u20b91,025.\n\nOn the daily chart, the stock has support at \u20b9985 level, signalling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increased buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips and entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss of \u20b9980 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b91,025 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.\n\n5. Ashok Leyland Ltd - Dongre recommends buying Ashok Leyland at \u20b9222, keeping a stop loss of \u20b9216 for a target price of \u20b9230.\n\nOn the short-term chart, this stock is forming a bullish engulfing pattern, which is inherently bullish. Currently priced at \u20b9222, this formation signals a potential upward trend. To effectively manage risk, a stop loss of \u20b9216 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b9230 in the upcoming weeks. This suggests a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory, backed by the bullish technical signals.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to global outlook amid Iran-Israel war; five stocks to buy on October 9\nStock Market Today: The benchmark Nifty-50 index rebounded 0.88% to end at 25,013.15 on Tuesday, after six consecutive days of decline led by concerns about the Iran-Israel war. The S&P BSE Sensex, also at 25,013.15, also ended with gains of 0.72%.\n\nMost sectors, with the exception of metals, ended with gains. Auto, energy, and pharma led, as Nifty Bank, at 51,021.00, was up 1.07%. The broader indices also saw a rebound, with the mid-and small-cap indexes rising over 2% each.\n\nTrade setup for Wednesday After the Nifty's rebound on Tuesday, the recovery in key heavyweights could drive Nifty further upward, sustaining this momentum may be challenging, said Ajit Mishra \u2013 SVP, Research, Religare Broking Ltd. Nifty faces an immediate resistance zone around 25,150-25,300, with a significant hurdle still at 25,500 as per Mishra\n\nOn the daily charts, Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan, expects the Bank Nifty to hold on to the support zone of 50400 \u2013 50200 and rise towards 51800 \u2013 52000 over the next few trading sessions.\n\nGlobal market amidst Iran-Israel war Asian indices remained mixed, with most indices, except for China, seeing a correction. The European Indices, too, remained under pressure.\n\nGood state election result for the ruling party, contrary to the exit polls, has brought some optimism in the domestic market, said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services..

BSE Limited - Bagadia recommends buying BSE at \u20b94242.65 with Stoploss at \u20b94085 for a target price of \u20b94500\n\nThe BSE daily chart indicates a significant shift in market dynamics, transitioning from a period of slight declines and sideways consolidation to a promising upward movement. The current trading session shows upward momentum, breaking out of a narrow range and forming a double-bottom pattern on the daily chart. Any move above 4300 could potentially signal a breakout to the upside. This development aligns with a positive short-term trend, supported by a notable increase in trading volume.\n\nGanesh Dongre's stocks to buy today 3. PVR Inox Ltd\u2014Dongre recommends buying PVR Inox at \u20b91606, keeping a Stoploss at \u20b91575, with a target price of \u20b91675.\n\nThe stock has substantial support at Rs.1575, marking a crucial juncture in its recent trading.

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to global outlook amid Iran-Israel war; five stocks to buy or sell on Oct 8\nStock Market Today: The Benchmark Nifty-50 Index, continuing its correction phase, ended a volatile trading session on Monday at 24,795.75, down 0.87. The S&P BSE Sensex, too, at 81,050.00, ended down 0.78%. Most of the sectors, with the exception of the IT Index, saw sharp cuts. Even Mid and Small-cap indexes were down 2.5%. Bank Nifty at 50,478.90 saw a steep correction of 1.91%\n\nTrade setup for Tuesday The underlying trend of Nifty remains negative. Having recently declined below the crucial support of 25100-25000 levels, Nagaraj Shetti, senior technical research analyst at HDFC Securities, said Nifty could slide down towards another lower support of around 24500-24400 in the near term.\n\nThe Nifty Bank index experienced a short-term trend line breakdown and closed below the 100-DSMA support, indicating further weakness. On the upside, the index will face immediate resistance near the 51,000\u201351,100 levels. In contrast, on the downside, the psychological level of 50,000 will act as important support, said Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP of Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C. Mehta Investment Intermediates Ltd.\n\nGlobal market amidst Iran-Israel war Asian markets rose on Monday, supported by strong US jobs data, while European markets were mixed. The US jobs data, however, failed to lift sentiments in India.\n\nIn addition to the internal market dynamics, geopolitical concerns are also shaping short-term domestic market direction. The escalating tensions between Iran and Israel have introduced a level of uncertainty and risk that investors find difficult to ignore, said Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research\u2014Investment Services, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.\n\nStocks to buy today Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking recommended two stock picks for Monday. Also, Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager - Technical Research at Anand Rathi suggested three stock ideas for today.\n\nThese include Gillette India Ltd , R R Kabel Ltd , Infosys Ltd , Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd .\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1.

If Gillette can sustain above the critical resistance level of \u20b98700, it is likely to continue its upward momentum, potentially moving towards a target price of \u20b99205.\n\n2. R R Kabel Ltd - Sumeet Bagadia recommends buying R R Kabel at \u20b91772.3 with Stoploss at \u20b91719 for a target price of \u20b91878\n\nRRKabel Ltd. is currently trading at \u20b91772.3, demonstrating a strong bullish trend.

The target price for this strategy is Rs. 6950 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.\n\n5. Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd- Dongre recommends buying M&M at \u20b93060 keeping Stop Loss at \u20b93000 for a target price of \u20b93140.\n\nOn the short-term chart, this stock is forming bullish engulfing pattern, which is inherently bullish.

On the upside, we expect a pullback towards 52,200 \u2013 52,600 with the crucial support zone placed at 51,400 \u2013 51,300, Gedia added.\n\nGlobal market amidst Iran-Israel war Global indices including Asia, Europe and the US were mostly higher on Friday after worsening tensions in the Middle East sent stocks lower on Thursday. While rising crude prices remain a concern, the US markets were boosted by the higher-than-expected non-farm payroll data.\n\n\u201cWe expect markets to consolidate next week amid cautiousness due to fear of increasing tensions in West Asia. With the start of the earning season next week, stock-specific action will continue,\u201d said Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.\n\nThe RBI's monetary policy will also remain in focus.

Bank Nifty settled at 51,845.20, down over 2%.\n\nTrade setup for Friday With the Nifty breaching multiple supports\u2014such as the 20-day exponential moving average (DEMA) around the 25,580 level and trendline support near 25,350\u2014the market could face further downside, said Ajit Mishra \u2013 SVP, Research, Religare Broking. We are now looking at the 25,000-25,150 zone as the next support, while any rebound is likely to be capped in the 25,450-25,600 range, added Mishra.\n\nBank Nifty which was leading the up move during the latter half of September is now correcting and leading the fall, said Jatin Gedia \u2013 Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan. He expects the fall to continue towards 49,700, the low it touched in August. On the upside, 52,600 \u2013 52,700 is a crucial resistance.\n\nGlobal Market Amidst Iran-Israel War Asian stocks retreated on Friday as oil prices surged, set to close the week with highest gains in almost a year. Australian and Japanese stock markets slipped while European futures were flat.\n\nInvestors are advised to remain cautious as they await upcoming Q2 earnings and monitor the policy decisions of the RBI's policy, said Vikram Kasat, Head - Advisory, Prabhudas Lilladher.

Also, Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager - Technical Research at Anand Rathi suggested three stock ideas for today.\n\nThese include Pitti Engineering, Sarda Energy & Minerals, InterGlobe Aviation (Indigo), Maharashtra Seamless, and Tata Communications.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1. Pitti Engineering - Bagadia Recommends buying Pitti Engineering at \u20b91,366.85, with a stop loss of \u20b91,325 and a target price of \u20b91,460.\n\nPitti Engineering is currently trading at 1,366.85 levels, showcasing a notable uptrend from the support levels around 1,265, near its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The stock's positive momentum is further confirmed by its positioning above the short-term (20-day), medium-term (50-day), and long-term (200-day) EMA levels, reinforcing its technical resilience.\n\n2. Sarda Energy & Minerals - Bagadia recommends buying Sarda Energy & Minerals at \u20b9491.95, with a stop loss of \u20b9472 and a target price of \u20b9520.\n\nSarda Energy & Mineral's daily chart analysis offers a favourable view for the following week, indicating a steady higher advance. Notably, the stock has produced a notable higher high and higher low pattern, and the company's recent upward swing has effectively violated the neckline, establishing a new week high. This breakthrough indicates the possibility of a significant follow-through upward increase in the stock price.\n\nGanesh Dongre's stocks to buy today 3.InterGlobe Aviation - Dongre advises buying InterGlobe Aviation (Indigo) at \u20b94,716, with a stop loss of \u20b94650 and a target price of \u20b94950.\n\nIn the recent short-term trend analysis of the stock, a notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged. This technical pattern suggests the possibility of a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially to \u20b94,950. At present, the stock is maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b94,650 Given the current market price of \u20b94,716, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors might consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b94,950.\n\n4. Maharashtra Seamless - Dongre recommends buying Maharashtra Seamless at \u20b9633, with a stop loss of \u20b9620 and a target price of \u20b9655.\n\nOn the daily chart of this stock, support at \u20b9620 level has been observed, signaling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss of \u20b9620 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b9655 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.\n\n5. Tata Communications - Dongre Recommends buying Tata Communications at \u20b92,145, with a stop loss of \u20b92,100 and a target price of \u20b92,300.\n\nOn the short-term chart, this stock is forming a bullish engulfing pattern, which is inherently bullish. Currently priced at \u20b92,145, this formation signals a potential upward trend. To effectively manage risk, a stop loss at \u20b92,100 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b92,300 in the upcoming weeks. This suggests potential gains as the stock continues its upward trajectory, backed by the bullish technical signals.",

The benchmark Nifty 50 index on Tuesday ended with gains of 0.14% at 25,418.55 up 34.80 points. S&P BSE Sensex was up 0.11% and at 83,079.66 ended Tuesday with gains of 90.88 points, very near the all time highs of 83,184.34.\n\nNifty Banking Index after a winning spree in past few sessions is consolidating and on Tuesday, ended at 52,188.65 up 35.5 points or 0.7%. The other key sectoral gainers included Autos, realty, Consumer Durables and Oil& Gas.\n\nAlso Read | Reliance Infra share price rises 6% on settlement of dues to Edelweiss\n\nTrade setup for Wednesday The narrow range movement continued in the market for the last three sessions and Nifty closed on Tuesday with minor gains. After opening with a positive note, the market was not able to show a decisive upside breakout of the range movement of the last few sessions around 25400 levels, said Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities,\n\nA sustainable up move above 25450-25500 could open the next upside target of 25800 in the near term. Immediate support is placed at 25200, said Shetti.\n\n\u201cBank Nifty started the day on a positive note but was unable to sustain higher levels, leading to consolidation within a narrow range,\u201d said Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C. Mehta Investment Interrmediates. \u201cTechnically, the index sustained above the cup-and-handle breakout level of 51,750, indicating potential strength. Therefore, the 51,700\u201351,750 zone will act as immediate support for Bank Nifty in the short term as per Yedve. If the index holds the 51,700 support, it could test levels of 52,800\u201353,000 in the short term.\u201d\n\nUS Fed rate cut in focus The two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting that started on 17 September 2024, has drawn attention from investors worldwide for months in the hopes that the US Federal Reserve will start lowering policy rates.

However, the frontline indices failed to recover the losses and ended lower. The Nifty 50 index finished 122 points lower at the 24,918 mark, the BSE Sensex corrected 398 points and closed at 81,523, whereas the Bank Nifty index ended 262 points lower at 51,010. In the broad market, the Small-cap index crashed 0.57 per cent, while the Mid-cap index ended 0.52 per cent lower.\n\nTrade setup for Thursday Speaking on the Nifty 50 index outlook, Rajesh Bhosale, Equity Technical Analyst at Angel One, said, \"Prices have again fallen below the 20 EMA, weakening their position and suggesting a potential retest of Monday's low around the 24750 level. If this support is broken, further weakness could push prices toward the 24500 mark. On the upside, 25100 - 25150 remains a strong resistance zone. The key levels to monitor on the weekly expiry day are 25000 - 25100 on the upside and 24800 - 24750 on the downside.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"Bank Nifty started the day on a flat-to-negative note, recovering slightly in the first half but faced selling pressure in the second half, ultimately closing negatively at 51,010. The index formed a red candle on the daily chart, reflecting weakness. On the downside, the 100-DEMA support is placed near 50,250, serving as a key level for Bank Nifty. On the upside, the 51,400-51,420 zone is a short-term hurdle. A sustainable move above 51,420 could push Bank Nifty towards 51,800-52,000 levels.\"\n\nGlobal markets today Stocks in Asia rose Thursday after a tech-fueled rally lifted Wall Street as traders looked beyond elevated core US inflation to imminent rate cuts next week. Equities in Japan and South Korea advanced, with the Topix up the most in almost a month.

The Nifty 50 rose by 0.42 percent, ending the day above the 25,000 mark at 25,041 points. The BSE Sensex also closed higher, climbing 0.43 percent to reach 81,912 points.\n\nTrade setup for Wednesday On the outlook for Nifty today, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said, \u201cNifty remained volatile throughout the day, unable to sustain levels above 25100. The RSI remained in a bearish crossover on the daily timeframe, indicating continued weakness. Sentiment is expected to stay weak in the near term unless Nifty manages a close above 25100. On the lower side, support is seen at 24900; if breached, the index may decline further towards 24750.\u201d\n\nAlso Read | Federal Bank to SBI Cards\u2014SMC Global lists four stocks to bet on this week\n\nOn the outlook for Bank Nifty, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C. Mehta Investment Interrmediates Ltd., said, \"Bank Nifty opened positively, successfully defending the support of the 50-day moving average and settled the day on a positive note at 51,272. Technically, on the daily scale, the index is still holding above a piercing line candle. If the index manages to sustain above 51,400 levels, a rally towards 51,800-52,000 could be possible in the short term. On the downside, immediate support is placed near the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average(DEMA), which is around 50,950, followed by the low of the piercing line candle, which is around 50,370.\u201d\n\nStocks to buy today Regarding shares to buy today, stock market experts \u2014 Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi \u2014 recommended buying these five shares: Inox Wind, Laurus Labs, Indraprastha Gas, MTAR Technologies, and JSW Steel.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Inox Wind: Buy at \u20b9 241.52, target \u20b9 255, stop loss \u20b9 233 INOXWIND has recently experienced a significant breakthrough above the crucial resistance zone ranging from 222 to 235 on the daily chart. This breakout has been accompanied by a consolidation of the upward movement, characterized by Higher High & Higher Low Pattern. The strong bullish sentiment is further validated by a noticeable surge in trading volume.\n\nKey technical indicators, particularly the Relative Strength Index (RSI), highlight the positive momentum in the stock. The RSI not only indicates favourable trends but also aligns with the stock trading above important moving averages, including the 20-day, 50-day, and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). This convergence underscores the continued strength in INOXWIND price action.\n\nIn summary, the decisive breakout, along with encouraging volume and the positive alignment of key technical indicators, suggests a bullish outlook for INOXWIND. Traders and investors may interpret this analysis as indicative of potential sustained upward momentum in the stock.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, we recommend INOXWIND in cash at the current market price (CMP) of 241.52, setting a target of 255, and implementing a stop loss at 233.\n\n2] Laurus Labs: Buy at \u20b9 506.7, target \u20b9 535, stop loss \u20b9 488 LAURUSLABS daily chart analysis offers a favourable view for the following week, indicating a steady higher advance. Notably, the stock has produced a notable higher high and higher low pattern, and the company's recent upward swing has effectively violated the neckline, establishing a new week high. This breakthrough indicates the possibility of a significant follow-through upward increase in the stock price.\n\nAdding to the positive momentum, there has been an increase in trading volume, indicating growing market interest. The stock formed a strong bullish momentum candle signifying a potential continuation of the uptrend following and the daily strength indicator RSI (14) is moving upwards and positioned above its reference line indicating a positive bias. Furthermore, LAURUSLABS is currently trading above its crucial 20-day, 50-day, and 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) levels, reinforcing the bullish trend. Given the overall chart pattern, the analysis suggests a favourable long trading opportunity for investors.\n\nBased on the above analysis we recommend buying LAURUSLABS in cash at CMP of 506.7 for the target of 535 with a stop loss of 488.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today 3] Indraprastha Gas: Buy at \u20b9 540, target \u20b9 560, stop loss \u20b9 525 In the recent short-term trend analysis of the stock, a notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged. This technical pattern suggests the possibility of a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around Rs. 560. At present, the stock is maintaining a crucial support level at Rs.525. Given the current market price of Rs.540, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors might consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of Rs. 560.\n\n4] MTAR Technologies: Buy at \u20b9 1810, target \u20b9 1875, stop loss \u20b9 1775 On the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the Rs. 1810 price level has been observed, signaling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss at Rs. 1775 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is Rs. 1875 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.\n\nAlso Read | Midcap defence stock snaps four-day losing streak on govt order win\n\n5] JSW Steel: Buy at \u20b9 938, target \u20b9 970, stop loss \u20b9 922 On the short-term chart, this stock is forming a rounding bottom pattern, which is inherently bullish. Currently priced at Rs. 938, this formation signals a potential upward trend. To effectively manage risk, a stop loss at Rs. 922 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is Rs. 970 in the upcoming weeks. This suggests a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory, backed by the bullish technical signals.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to India VIX, five stocks to buy or sell on Monday \u2014 Sept 9\nIndian stock market: The Indian stock market closed lower on Friday, breaking a three-week winning streak, as investors exercised caution ahead of a key US jobs report that could influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on the pace and extent of interest rate cuts. The Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex ended Friday's session in negative territory. The Nifty 50 dropped by 1.17 percent, closing at 24,852 points, while the BSE Sensex declined 1.25 percent, finishing at 81,170 points.\n\nTrade setup for Monday On the Nifty outlook, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C. Mehta Investment Interrmediates Ltd., said, \u201cThe Nifty started the week on a positive note, but global uncertainty dampened market sentiment, leading the index to close the week negatively at 24,852. On the daily chart, Nifty closed below its 21-Day Exponential Moving Average (DEMA), indicating further weakness. The next major support is near 24,480, where the 50-DEMA is positioned. In the short term, any bounce should be seen as an opportunity to book profits.\u201d\n\nOn the Bank Nifty outlook, Yedve added, \"Bank Nifty opened with a gap-down on Friday and showed weakness throughout the day, closing on a negative note at 50,577 levels. Technically, the index formed a large red candle on the daily chart, indicating weakness. On the weekly scale, index has formed a bearish engulfing candle, which supports a negative bias. On the upside, the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (DEMA), near 50,940, will act as an immediate hurdle. Thus, any bounce near 50,940 should be used for booking profits. On the downside, 50,000 and 49,650 will serve as key support levels for Bank Nifty in the short term.\"\n\nStocks to buy today Regarding shares to buy today, stock market experts \u2014 Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi \u2014 recommended these five shares: Inox Wind, Max Health, Sonata Software Ltd, Zomato, and MTAR Technologies Ltd.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stock recommendations today 1] Inox Wind: Buy at \u20b9 225.88 | Target Price: \u20b9 246 | Stop Loss: \u20b9 216 INOXWIND is currently trading at \u20b9225.88 and is in an upward trend, consistently forming higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart. The stock is consolidating near its historical peaks and shows signs of attempting to break through higher levels, supported by notable trading volumes, which reflect the strength of the trend. If INOXWIND surpasses the \u20b9230 mark, it could potentially advance toward a target of \u20b9246.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 67.32 and is on the verge of a positive crossover, indicating increased buying momentum. Additionally, INOXWIND has found support near its short-term (20-day) EMA levels, which reinforces the bullish trajectory.\n\nIn summary, based on the technical setup and indicators (RSI and moving averages), buying INOXWIND at \u20b9225.88 with a stop loss at \u20b9216 and a target price of \u20b9246 presents a compelling opportunity for potential gains.\n\n2] Max Health: Buy at \u20b9 898.55 | Target Price: \u20b9 980 | Stop Loss: \u20b9 858 MAXHEALTH is currently trading at \u20b9898.55 and is in a long-term uptrend, consistently forming higher highs and higher lows on the daily timeframe. The stock recently experienced a pullback from higher levels but has reversed from strong support areas, indicating that the bullish trend is likely to continue. If the stock can close above the \u20b9920 level, it is poised to potentially move toward an upward target of \u20b9980.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 57.05 and trending upward, further supporting the bullish momentum. Additionally, MAXHEALTH has surpassed its key moving averages, including the 20-day and 50-day EMAs, confirming the strength of the current uptrend.\n\nBased on this analysis, we recommend buying MAXHEALTH at \u20b9898.55, with a stop loss set at \u20b9858 and a target of \u20b9980.

The Nifty 50 index lost 53 points and closed at 25,145, the BSE Sensex shed 151 points and finished at 82,201, whereas the Bank Nifty index went up 72 points and ended at 51,473. Cash market volumes on the NSE were 4.2 per cent higher than the previous day. The broad market indices ended positively, even as the advance-decline ratio remained positive at 1.44:1.\n\nTrade setup for Friday Speaking on the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The short-term trend of the Nifty 50 index continues to be choppy with weak bias. Further weakness from here could find key lower support around 25000-24900 levels before showing a sustainable upside bounce again from the lows. Immediate resistance is placed at 25300.\"\n\nOn the outlook for Bank Nifty today, Dhupesh Dhameja, Technical Analyst at SAMCO Securities, said, \"The Nifty Bank index opened with a 144-point gap-up but remained subdued, trading in a narrow range of 51,400 to 51,550. Despite a volatile start, the index closed nearly flat, down 0.14% at 51,473. On the 1-hour chart, the index continues to trade within an upward-sloping channel. Consistent support has been found at the 51,300 level, with the 50-period EMA on the hourly chart as a crucial \"make or break\" point. Strong resistance at 51,500 has created a tight range that may define the index's next move.\"\n\n\"India VIX slipped 1.88 per cent, settling at 14.20, down from 14.37. Despite the decline, VIX trading above last week's high suggests elevated volatility, though staying below 15 gives bulls some breathing room,\" the SAMCO Securities expert said.\n\nStocks to buy today Regarding shares to buy today, stock market experts \u2014 Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi \u2014 recommended these five shares: Alkem Laboratories, Aditya Vision, Sonata Software, MTAR Technologies, and Global Health.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stock recommendations today 1] Alkem Lab: Buy at \u20b96276.55, target \u20b96600, stop loss \u20b96050.\n\nAlkem Lab's daily chart analysis offers a favourable view for the following week, indicating a steady higher advance. Notably, the stock has produced a notable higher high and higher low pattern, and the company's recent upward swing has effectively violated the neckline, establishing a new week high. This breakthrough indicates the possibility of a significant follow-through upward increase in the stock price.\n\n2] Aditya Vision: Buy at 552.05, target \u20b9585, stop loss \u20b9530.\n\nAditya Vision Limited's daily chart analysis reveals a notable shift in market dynamics, transitioning from minor declines and sideways consolidation to a promising upside bounce. The current trading session reflects an up move, potentially signalling an upside breakout from a narrow range momentum. This development aligns with a positive short-term trend, further reinforced by a surge in trading volume.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today 3] Sonata Software: Buy at \u20b9677, target \u20b9710, stop loss \u20b9663.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis. This technical pattern suggests a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around \u20b9710. The stock is currently maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b9660. A buying opportunity is emerging, given the current market price of \u20b9677. This suggests that investors consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b9710.\n\n4] MTAR Technologies: Buy at \u20b91810, target \u20b91875, stop loss \u20b91775.\n\nOn the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the Rs. 1810 price level has been observed, signalling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss at Rs. 1775 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is Rs. 1875 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.\n\n5] Global Health: Buy at \u20b91143, target \u20b91220, 1110.\n\nOn the short-term chart, this stock is forming an inherently bullish rounding bottom pattern. Currently priced at \u20b91143, this formation signals a potential upward trend. To effectively manage risk, a stop loss of \u20b91110 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b91220 in the upcoming weeks. This suggests a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory, backed by the bullish technical signals.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to US job data, five stocks to buy or sell on Thursday \u2014 Sept 5\nStock market today: After rising for fourteen straight sessions, the Indian stock market finally came under the profit-booking trigger on Wednesday. The Nifty 50 index went off 81 points and closed at the 25,198 mark, the BSE Sensex corrected 202 points and finished at 82,352, whereas the Bank Nifty index ended 288 points lower at 51,400. In the broad market, the small-cap stocks continue to attract bulls as the BSE Small-cap index finished 0.26 per cent higher in the previous session.\n\nTrade setup for Thursday Speaking on the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The near-term uptrend status remains intact for Nifty, and any consolidations and minor dips down to the 25K mark are expected to be a buying opportunity. One may expect Nifty to surge towards the new all-time highs around 25350-25400 soon.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"The Bank Nifty began the day with a gap-down but later witnessed buying interest. Despite this, the index closed negatively at 51,400 levels. Technically, the daily chart shows the index forming a small green candle, indicating lower-level buying interest. On the downside, the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) is near 51,090 levels. If the index remains above 51,090, a \"buy on dips\" strategy is recommended. On the upside, the Bank Nifty might attempt to test the 52,000 level, which corresponds to the target of the double bottom pattern.\"\n\nUS Job data Data overnight showed that US job openings dropped to a 3-1/2-year low in July, suggesting the labour market was losing steam. However, the reduction alone is probably insufficient to warrant a half-percentage-point rate cut by the Federal Reserve this month.\n\nGlobal markets today The US dollar rates came under pressure after the weak US Job report on Wednesday, fueling the Japanese Yen during the early morning session on Thursday. Treasuries across the Asian markets witnessed strong buying in the early morning session. Asian stock futures were mixed. The future contracts for Japan fell more than 1 per cent, while those for Australia and Hong Kong changed slightly. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 ended Wednesday 0.2 per cent lower as Nvidia's share price saw its worst two-day plunge since October 2022 amid a report about the US Department of Justice sending out subpoenas as part of an antitrust probe.\n\nIn Asia, traders will closely watch Nippon Steel's shares. After US President Joe Bi, according to people familiar with the matter, the den was said to block the Japanese steelmaker's $14.1 billion takeover of United States Steel Cor. Shares of US Steel closed 17% lower in New York, the most significant decline since April 2017.\n\nStocks to buy today Regarding shares to buy today, stock market experts \u2014 Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi \u2014 recommended these five stocks: Syngene International, United Spirits, JSW Steel, MTAR Technologies, and State Bank of India (SBI).\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stock recommendations today 1] Syngene International: Buy at \u20b9879.65, target \u20b9925, stop loss \u20b9850.\n\nSyngene share price is in a strong uptrend, with a trading price of \u20b9879.65. The stock has been consistently moving upwards, forming a bullish continuation pattern, exhibiting moves with higher highs and higher lows. The latest candlestick formation shows a bullish trend, signalling further upside potential with a target of \u20b9925 and support at \u20b9830.\n\n2] United Spirits: Buy at \u20b91499.35, target \u20b91585, stop loss \u20b91449.\n\nUnited Spirits share is trading at \u20b91499.35 and has touched an all-time high today at \u20b91507. The stock shows bullish, solid momentum with a continuous uptrend on the daily chart. If the stock continues to rise, the target could be around \u20b91585, with a support level of \u20b91435.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today 3] JSW Steel: Buy at \u20b9932, target \u20b9955, stop loss \u20b9920.\n\nThe stock found a substantial support level at \u20b9920, marking a crucial juncture in its recent trading. At \u20b9932, the stock has demonstrated a definitive price-action reversal, suggesting a potential continuation of its upward momentum. Traders keen on seizing this opportunity could consider buying and holding the stock, setting a prudent stop loss at \u20b9920. The anticipated target for this trade is \u20b9955, representing the next significant resistance level. This strategy positions traders favourably to capitalize on the stock's expected rally in the weeks ahead.\n\n4] MTAR Technologies: Buy at \u20b91810, target \u20b91880, stop loss \u20b91770.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis. This technical pattern suggests a temporary retracement of the stock price, potentially reaching around \u20b91880. The stock is currently maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b91770. Given the current market price of \u20b91810, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b91880.\n\n5] SBI: Buy at \u20b9816, target \u20b9845, stop loss \u20b9800.\n\nOn the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the Rs.816 price level has been observed, signalling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss of \u20b9800 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b9845 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.\n\n(With inputs from Reuters)",

The Sensex began at 82,652.69, slightly above its previous closing of 82,559.84. It moved within a narrow range of approximately 274 points and finished 4 points lower at 82,555.44. The Nifty 50 opened at 25,313.40, marginally above its prior close of 25,278.70, and reached an intraday high of 25,321.70 and a low of 25,235.80. It ended the day up by just 1 point at 25,279.85.\n\nTrade setup for Tuesday On the Nifty outlook, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities, said, \u201cNifty remained rangebound, closing positively for the 14th consecutive day. It encountered resistance at 25,300, highlighting strong call option writing at that strike. Moving forward, only a decisive move above 25,300 might trigger a rally toward 25,500. On the downside, support is positioned at 25,200 and 25,000.\u201d\n\nAlso Read | From Persistent to Hind Petro - Motilal Oswal suggests 3 stocks for this week\n\nOn the Bank Nifty outlook, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C. Mehta Investment Interrmediates Ltd, said, \"The Bank Nifty began the day on a strong note but encountered profit booking in the first half. However, the index witnessed strong buying interest in the second half and settled the day positively at 51,689 levels. Technically, on the daily chart, the index formed a green candle with a long lower shadow, indicating strength. On the downside, the 21-Day Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) is near 51,060 levels. As long as the index remains above 51,060, a 'buy on dips' strategy is recommended. On the upside, the Bank nifty might attempt to test the levels of 52000, which correspond to the double bottom pattern target.\u201d\n\nGlobal markets today \u201cAmid mixed global signals and the absence of significant new catalysts, aside from the anticipated Fed rate cut, which is already factored in, the domestic market took a breather. Mild caution emerged due to a recent slowdown in manufacturing activities, which indicates a slowdown in demand. However, predictions of an above-normal monsoon extending through September and accelerated capex by the GoI in the H2FY25 boosted consumption and rural based stocks like FMCG stocks,\u201d said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.\n\nStocks to buy today Regarding shares to buy today, stock market experts \u2014 Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi \u2014 recommended buying these five stocks: Kajaria Ceramics, ICICI Bank, Zomato, JK Lakshmi Cement, and Finolex Cables.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stock recommendations today 1] Kajaria Ceramics: Buy at \u20b9 1386.2, target \u20b9 1500, stop loss \u20b9 1328 KAJARIACER is currently trading at 1386.2 and is in a consolidation phase. After reaching an all-time high, the stock has stabilized near its demand zone. Recently, the stock broke out of a falling trend line on the daily chart and formed a double-bottom pattern, signaling a potential trend reversal supported by a bounce. If KAJARIACER can sustain above the 1400 level, it may continue its upward trajectory towards the 1500 mark.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 50.73, with a positive crossover, indicating increasing buying momentum. Additionally, KAJARIACER has rebounded from its long-term (200-day) EMA and has moved above its short-term (20-day) EMA and medium-term (50-day) EMA levels, further reinforcing the strength of the current uptrend.\n\nGiven the current technical indicators and price action, KAJARIACER appears well-positioned above the resistance level for a potential upward move. Investors might consider buying on dips, with a stop loss set at 1328 to manage risk. The target price of 1500 aligns with resistance levels and offers a favorable risk-reward ratio, making this a promising trading opportunity.Global\n\nAlso Read | Alembic Pharma to Hindustan Copper\u2014SMC Global lists four stocks for this week\n\n2] ICICI Bank: Buy at \u20b9 1247.70, target \u20b9 1320, stop loss \u20b9 1210 ICICI Bank has demonstrated noteworthy resilience, staging a strong move towards its all-time high levels. The stock has a strong support at 1210 in close proximity to its 20-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The stock, currently trading at 1247.70, exhibits a positive trajectory, indicative of underlying strength. Significantly, the stock is trading above key moving averages reinforces the stock's robust position.\n\nAn observable hurdle surfaces around 1258, constituting a minor resistance which is also all-time high for the stock. A successful breach of this level holds the potential to propel the stock towards the target of 1320 and beyond. This analysis reflects the stock's resilience, technical strength, and the possibility of continued upward movement, offering valuable insights for investors navigating the dynamic market landscape.\n\nBased on the above analysis we expect ICICIBANK to move higher towards 1320 and hence we recommend buying ICICIBANK at CMP of 1247.70 with a SL of 1210.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today 3] Zomato: Buy at \u20b9 248, target \u20b9 260, stop loss \u20b9 242 In the recent short-term trend analysis of the Zomato stock, a notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged. This technical pattern suggests the possibility of a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around Rs. 260. At present, the stock is maintaining a crucial support level at Rs.242. Given the current market price of Rs.248, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors might consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of Rs. 260.\n\n4] JK Lakshmi Cement: Buy at \u20b9 788, target \u20b9 815, stop loss \u20b9 775 On the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the Rs. 788 price level has been observed, signaling a potential upward trend.

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to global markets, five stocks to buy or sell on Tuesday \u2014 Sept 3\nStock market today: Despite mixed trends in the Asian stock markets and a retreat in the European stock market from the record high, the Indian stock market extended its uptrend for the 13th straight session. The Nifty 50 index finished 37 points higher at the 25,273 mark, the BSE Sensex went up 194 points and closed at 82,559, while the Bank Nifty index ended 71 points upward at 51,422. Cash market volumes on the NSE were low at \u20b91.11 lakh crore. The broad market indices ended minorly in the negative even as the advance-decline ratio dipped to 0.98:1.\n\nTrade setup for Tuesday Speaking on the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The short-term trend of Nifty is intact. Though Nifty is placed at the hurdles of around 25,350 (1.382% Fibonacci extension), there is still no indication of any significant reversal pattern building at the highs. A decisive move only above 25,400 could open the next upside target of 25,800. Immediate support for Nifty today is placed at 25,100.\"\n\nOn the outlook for Bank Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"The Bank Nifty began the day on a strong note but encountered profit booking and settled the day positively at 51,440 levels. Technically, the index formed a red candle on the daily chart but stayed above the trend line support and the 21-DEMA, which is near 51,000. As long as the index remains above 51,000, a 'buy on dips' strategy is recommended. On the upside, the rally might extend to 51,800-52,000.\"\n\nGlobal markets today \"While key indices continued to be in a record-breaking spree on the back of selective buying in frontline stocks, several sectoral indices ended in red, indicating that the bulls are beginning to lose steam. Investors would wait for the outcome of the key US jobs data to be released on Friday, which will be key for interest rate decisions by the US Fed in the current month,\" said Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd.\n\nStocks to buy today Regarding shares to buy today, stock market experts \u2014 Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi \u2014 recommended buying these five stocks: Thangamayil Jewellery, Patanjali Foods, Balkrishna Industries, ONGC, and Wipro.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stock recommendations today 1] Thangamayil Jewellery: Buy at \u20b92227.15, target \u20b92345, stop loss \u20b92145.\n\nThangamayil Jewellery is exhibiting bullish solid momentum, trading at an all-time high of 2320.95. The recent breakout above the crucial resistance at 2150 levels is a significant technical development, supported by robust trading volumes, reinforcing the strength in the stock. The breakthrough suggests a potential continuation of the upward trend, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.\n\n2] Patanjali Foods: Buy at \u20b91969.45, target \u20b92070, stop loss \u20b91899.\n\nPatanjali Foods' daily chart analysis offers a favourable view for the following week, indicating a steady higher advance. Notably, the stock has produced a notable higher high and higher low pattern, and the company's recent upward swing has effectively violated the neckline, establishing a new week high. This breakthrough indicates the possibility of a significant follow-through upward increase in the stock price.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today 3] Balkrishna Industries: Buy at \u20b92895, target \u20b92995, stop loss \u20b92850.\n\nThe stock found a substantial support level at Rs.2850, marking a crucial juncture in its recent trading. At \u20b92895, the stock has demonstrated a definitive price-action reversal, suggesting a potential continuation of its upward momentum. Traders keen on seizing this opportunity could consider buying and holding the stock, setting a prudent stop loss at \u20b92850. The anticipated target for this trade is \u20b92995, representing the next significant resistance level. This strategy positions traders favourably to capitalize on the stock's expected rally soon.\n\n4] ONGC: Buy at \u20b9326, target \u20b9345, stop loss \u20b9320.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis. This technical pattern suggests a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around \u20b9345. The stock is currently maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b9320. Given the current market price of \u20b9326, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b9345.\n\n5] Wipro: Buy at \u20b9532, target \u20b9555, stop loss \u20b9508.\n\nOn the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the \u20b9532 price level has been observed, signalling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss of \u20b9508 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b9555 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.",

The Nifty 50 index registered its best winning streak since its launch in 1996 by rising on the 12th day in a row. The 50-stock index finished 83 points higher at the 25,235 mark, the BSE Sensex shot up 231 points and closed at 82,365, whereas the Nifty Bank index ended 198 points higher at 51,351.\n\nDue to index rebalancing volumes, cash market volumes on the NSE were around 71% higher than the previous day. The broad market indices rose more than the Nifty even as the advance-decline ratio rose to 1.39:1.\n\nTrade setup for Monday On the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The short-term trend of Nifty remains positive, but the market cannot gather sharp upside momentum into new highs. One may expect further consolidation or a minor dip from near the resistance of 25,300 to 25,400 levels.

As long as the index remains over 50,950, a 'buy on dips' strategy is recommended. On the upside, the rally might extend to 51,800-52,000 levels.\"\n\nGlobal markets today In the early morning session on Monday, Asian markets mostly followed Friday's rally on Wall Street, with Japan's Nikkei up 1.0% and adding to last week's 8.7% bounce. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged down 0.1%, while South Korean stocks were flat. Cash treasuries were untraded for the holidays, while Treasury futures were moved a little. Ten-year yields stood at 3.914% after rising due to Friday's inflation and spending data.\n\nStocks to buy today Regarding shares to buy today, stock market experts \u2014 Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi \u2014 recommended buying these five stocks: Safari Industries, PNB Housing Finance, Axis Bank, Balrampur Chini, and Birlasoft.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks 1] Safari Industries: Buy at \u20b92476.20, target \u20b92615, stop loss \u20b92390.\n\nSAFARI is currently trading at \u20b92476.20.

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to global markets, five stocks to buy or sell on Wednesday\nStock market today: On Tuesday, August 27, Indian stock market benchmarks, the Nifty 50 and the Sensex, ended the day flat. The Nifty 50 inched up by 7 points to close at 25,017.75, while the Sensex edged up by 14 points, finishing at 81,711.76. In contrast, the mid-cap and small-cap segments saw notable gains, with the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices each rising by half a percent.\n\nTrade setup for Wednesday On the outlook for Nifty today, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities, said, \u201cThe sentiment has entered an indecisive phase as the Nifty closed with a Doji pattern on the daily chart. The significant presence of both call and put option writers at the 25,000 strike price strengthens the technical setup. As a result, the Nifty is likely to remain range-bound or might experience a slight dip in the near term. On the lower end, 24,800 could act as immediate support, while a rise above 25,100 might push the Nifty towards 25,300.\u201d\n\nAlso Read | Breakout stocks to buy or sell: Sumeet Bagadia recommends five shares to buy\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C. Mehta Investment Interrmediates Ltd, said, \"The Bank Nifty opened on a positive note, witnessed buying interest, and settled the day on a positive note at 51,279 levels. Technically, the Bank Nifty, on a daily scale, has formed a green candle and managed to close above the trend line resistance, indicating strength. Moreover, the index is holding firmly above its 21-DEMA support, which is placed near 50,860 levels. As long as the index holds above 50,860, a \"buy on dips\" strategy is advisable. On the upside, the 51,800-52,000 range will act as resistance in the short term.\u201d\n\nStocks to buy today Regarding shares to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended five stocks.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stock recommendations today 1] Godrej Industries: Buy at \u20b9 1009.6, target \u20b9 1064, stop loss \u20b9 973 Godrej Industries share price is currently around \u20b91,009.6. After a period of small falls and sideways consolidation, the stock has lately broken the neckline levels of \u20b9960 and is rising quickly on the upside with substantial volume. There are expectations of further upward movement, potentially reaching \u20b91,064 levels. On the downside, substantial support is evident near \u20b9973.\n\nFurthermore, Godrej Industries shares are trading above key Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), including the 20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day EMAs. This suggests a strong bullish momentum, indicating the potential for continued upward price action. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 76.19, signalling an upward trajectory and confirming an increase in buying momentum.\n\nTo manage risk effectively, it is advisable to set a stop-loss (SL) at \u20b9973 to protect the investment in case of an unexpected market reversal.\n\nIn summary, considering the technical analysis and prevailing market conditions, Godrej Industries stock appears to present a promising buying opportunity for those targeting a \u20b91,064 price objective, contingent upon the implementation of prudent risk management measures.\n\nAlso Read | Indian stock market: 8 key things that changed for market overnight\n\n2] ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co Ltd: Buy at \u20b9 2153.35, target \u20b9 2277, stop loss \u20b9 2077 ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company is in a long-term uptrend and is currently trading near its all-time high of \u20b92,153.35, consistently forming higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart. The stock recently formed a strong bullish candle, supported by high trading volumes, which indicates a continuation of the uptrend. After bouncing from its support zones, if the stock maintains its position above the \u20b92,160 level, it could potentially move further towards an upside target of \u20b92,277.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 76.54, suggesting that the stock is not yet in overbought territory, leaving room for additional upward movement. Moreover, ICICI Lombard share price has recently bounced from its short-term (20-day) Exponential Moving Average (EMA), signaling strong support at these levels.\n\nBased on these technical indicators, we recommend taking a long position in ICICI Lombard stock at \u20b92,153.35. Set a stop loss at \u20b92,077 to manage risk, and aim for a target price of \u20b92,277, aligning with the current favorable market sentiment.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today 3] NCC Ltd: Buy at \u20b9 328, target \u20b9 345, stop loss \u20b9 315 In the recent short-term trend analysis of the NCC stock, a notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged. This technical pattern suggests the possibility of a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around \u20b9345. At present, the stock is maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b9315. Given the current market price of \u20b9328, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors might consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b9345.\n\n4] Reliance Industries: Buy at \u20b9 3002, target \u20b9 3060, stop loss \u20b9 3950 On the daily chart of Reliance Industries stock, a breakout at the \u20b93,002 price level has been observed, signaling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying Reliance shares on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss at \u20b92,950 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b93,060 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the Reliance Industries stock continues its upward trajectory.\n\n5] Tata Power: Buy at \u20b9 429, target \u20b9 445, stop loss \u20b9 420 On the short-term chart, Tata Power stock is forming a rounding bottom pattern, which is inherently bullish. Currently priced at \u20b9429, this formation signals a potential upward trend. To effectively manage risk, a stop loss at \u20b9420 is recommended.\n\nThe target price for this strategy is \u20b9445 in the upcoming weeks. This suggests a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory, backed by the bullish technical signals.",

The Nifty 50 index regained the psychological 25,000 peak and ended at 25,010. The BSE Sensex surged 611 points and closed at 81,698, while the Bank Nifty index finished 214 points higher at 51,148.

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to US Fed rate cut, five stocks to buy or sell on Monday \u2014 August 26\nStock market today: The Indian stock market finished on a higher note despite trading sideways throughout the week. The Nifty 50 index finished at 24,823, logging a weekly gain of 283 points or 1.15 per cent. The BSE Sensex ended with a weekly gain of 0.80 per cent or 650 points at 81,086. The Bank Nifty index recorded a weekly gain of around 0.83 per cent and closed at 50,933. In the broad market, the Small-cap and Mid-cap indices outperformed the frontline Indian indices. The Small-cap index recorded a weekly gain of around 3.40 per cent, whereas the Mid-cap index registered a 1.95 per cent rise last week.\n\nTrade setup for Monday Speaking on the outlook of Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The underlying trend of Nifty continues to be choppy with a positive bias. A further upmove from here could pull Nifty towards 25000-25100 levels in the near term. Immediate support is at 24650.\"\n\nOn the outlook of Bank Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"The Bank Nifty opened on a positive note but encountered trend line resistance, leading to profit booking, and eventually settled the day on a negative note at 50,933 levels. Technically, the Bank Nifty has formed a red candle near the trend line resistance around 51,200 levels. However, the index held above its 21-DEMA support, near the 50,790 level. The index has formed a bullish candle on the weekly scale, indicating strength. As long as the index holds above 50,790, a \"buy on dips\" strategy is advisable. On the upside, trend line resistance near 51,200 levels remains a key barrier. Sustaining above 51,200 could open the path towards the 51,500 to 51,800 levels.\"\n\nUS Fed rate cut buzz Expecting a positive trend to continue in the Indian stock market, Naveen Kulkarni, Chief Investment Officer at Axis Securities PMS, said, \u201cThe recent comments from the US Federal Reserve chairman regarding interest rates were not surprising. The market expects an interest rate cut during the next Federal Reserve meeting in September. The big question is how quickly the rates will be reduced. There are indications that the rate cuts could happen faster, especially with the weakening of jobs data. However, Powell believes the chances of the US economy entering a recession soon are very low. This implies that rate cuts would likely align with consensus expectations, and the possibility of higher rates may be lower. Overall, the regime of high interest rates is coming to a close. Still, the likelihood of returning to an ultra-low interest rate environment also appears low.\u201d\n\nStocks to buy today Regarding shares to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended buying Welspun Enterprises, TVS Electronics, Swan Energy, Tata Motors, and Jindal Steel.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks 1] Welspun Enterprises: Buy at \u20b9601.25, target \u20b9633, stop loss \u20b9580.\n\nWelspun Enterprises, presently trading at an all-time high of \u20b9610, is displaying significant bullish momentum. Substantial trading volumes have backed the recent breakout above the critical resistance at \u20b9575, an essential technical development highlighting the strength of the stock. The discovery raises the possibility that the upward trend would continue, providing investors with a positive outlook.\n\n2] TVS Electronics: Buy at \u20b9@ 445.90, target \u20b9469, stop loss \u20b9430.\n\nThe daily chart analysis of TVS Electronics reveals a promising outlook for the upcoming week, signalling a sustained upward movement. Notably, the stock has formed a significantly higher high and higher low pattern, and the recent upward swing has successfully breached the neckline, establishing a new week high for the stock. This breakout suggests the potential for a substantial follow-through upward movement in the stock price.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today 3] Swan Energy: Buy at \u20b9700, target \u20b9745, stop loss \u20b9680.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis. This technical pattern suggests a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around \u20b9745. The stock is currently maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b9680. Given the current price of \u20b9700, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b9745.\n\n4] Tata Motors: Buy at \u20b91088, target \u20b91130, stop loss \u20b91065.\n\nOn the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the Rs. 1088 price level has been observed, signalling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss of \u20b91065 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b91130 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.\n\n5] Jindal Steel: Buy at \u20b9960, target \u20b9990, stop loss \u20b9940.\n\nOn the short-term chart, this stock is forming an inherently bullish rounding bottom pattern. Currently priced at \u20b9960, this formation signals a potential upward trend. To effectively manage risk, a stop loss of \u20b9940 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b9990 in the upcoming weeks. This suggests a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory, backed by the bullish technical signals.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to US Fed minutes, five stocks to buy or sell on Thursday \u2014 August 22\nStock market today: The upside momentum with range-bound action continued in the Indian stock market on Wednesday. The Nifty 50 index surged 71 points and closed at the 24,770 mark; the BSE Sensex finished 102 points higher at 80,905, whereas the Bank Nifty index lost 117 points and ended at 50,685. However, the broad market outperformed the frontline indices, as the Small-cap index finished 0.87 per cent higher while the Mid-cap index closed 0.43 per cent upside.\n\nTrade setup for Thursday On the Nifty 50 index outlook, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The short-term trend of Nifty continues to be positive with range-bound action. The market is now set to challenge another opening down gap resistance of 2nd August around 24,960. Hence, Nifty may move towards 24,960 and 25,100 next week. Immediate support for Nifty today is placed at 24,650.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"The Bank Nifty opened with a gap down and remained under pressure in the first half. However, the index recovered in the second half, which helped it settle the day on a marginal negative note at 50,686. Technically, Bank Nifty formed a doji candle on the daily chart but failed to close above the 21-DEMA, which is around 50,760. A sustainable move above 50,800 could push the index towards the 51,200-51,500 zone.\"\n\nUS Fed meeting in focus \"According to the US Fed minutes, most members favour an interest rate cut provided the progress in US inflation continues. So, bets are high about the beginning of the rate cut from the September US Fed meeting. Hence, we may expect bulls to outperform bears in the next few sessions,\" said Avinash Gorakshkar, Head of Research at Profitmart Securities.\n\nStocks to buy today Regarding shares to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended buying these five stocks: Suven Pharmaceuticals, Rupa, Swan Energy, Chennai Petroleum Corporation, and Deepak Fertilisers.\n\nSumeet Bagadia stock recommendations 1] Suven Pharmaceuticals: Buy at \u20b91020.60, target \u20b91105, stop loss \u20b9980.\n\nSUVENPHAR is currently in an upward trend, forming higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart. The stock is trading within a consolidation range near its historical peaks. It shows signs of attempting to break through higher levels by forming a solid bullish candle that reflects the trend's strength. If SUVENPHAR surpasses the \u20b91030 mark, it could reach a target of \u20b91105.\n\n2] Rupa: Buy at \u20b9345.50, target \u20b9363, stop loss \u20b9333.\n\nRUPA has recently exhibited a robust breakout from the critical resistance zone of \u20b9320 to \u20b9333 on the daily chart, consolidating the move with higher highs and higher lows. This breakout is supported by a notable increase in trading volume, indicating strong bullish sentiment.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today 3] Swan Energy: Buy at \u20b9700, target \u20b9745, stop loss \u20b9680.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis. This technical pattern suggests a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around \u20b9745. The stock is currently maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b9680. Given the current price of \u20b9700, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b9745.\n\n4] Chennai Petroleum Corporation: Buy at \u20b9992, target \u20b91040, stop loss \u20b9970.\n\nOn the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the \u20b9992 price level has been observed, signalling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss of \u20b9970 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b91040 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.\n\n5] Deepak Fertilisers: Buy at \u20b92954, target \u20b93050, stop loss \u20b92910.\n\nThis stock is forming an inherently bullish rounding bottom pattern on the short-term chart. Currently priced at \u20b92954, this formation signals a potential upward trend. To effectively manage risk, a stop loss at \u20b92910 is recommended.\n\nThe target price for this strategy is \u20b93050 in the upcoming weeks. This suggests a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory, backed by the bullish technical signals.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to Sensex, four stocks to buy or sell on Wednesday \u2014 August 21\nStock market today: The Indian stock market experienced strong buying, with the Nifty 50 and Sensex both closing up by half a percent, largely due to favorable global cues, on Tuesday. The Sensex ended the day up by 378 points, or 0.47%, reaching 80,802.86, while the Nifty 50 finished 126 points, or 0.51%, higher at 24,698.85.\n\nTrade setup for Wednesday On the outlook for Nifty, Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical & Derivatives, Angel One said, \u201cNifty is likely to encounter resistance around the subzone 24,800-24,850, after which another set of bearish gap is situated. On the downside, the pivotal zone 24,600-24,500 is anticipated to act as a support level for any short-term decline, followed by the 20-day EMA positioned around 24,400.\u201d\n\nAlso Read | Bajaj Consumer Care to ICICI Bank\u2014SMC Global lists four stocks for this week\n\nOn the Bank Nifty outlook, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C. Mehta Investment Interrmediates Ltd., said, \"The Bank Nifty also opened with a gap up and saw continuous buying interest. Consequently, the index ended the day on a positive note at 50,803. Technically, the Bank Nifty formed a green candle on the daily chart, indicating strength. The index registered a high of 51,026 and closed just above the barrier of the 21-DEMA (50,770), indicating further bullishness. Sustenance above 50,770 could push the index towards the 51,200-51,500 zone.\u201d\n\nStocks to buy today Regarding shares to buy today, stock market experts \u2014 Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi \u2014 recommended five intraday stocks for today.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stock recommendations today 1] Kotak Bank: Buy at \u20b9 1,805.65, target \u20b9 1,915, stop loss \u20b9 1,750 KOTAKBANK is trading at 1805.65 and has recently broken out of a Descending Triangle pattern on the daily chart. The stock has formed a strong bullish candle, supported by increased trading volumes, indicating strength in the current trend. If the price sustains above \u20b91,825 levels, it could potentially advance towards a target of \u20b91,915. On the downside, immediate support is at \u20b91,765.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 55.7 and trending upward, signalling increased buying momentum. Additionally, KOTAKBANK has surpassed its short-term (20-day), medium-term (50-day), and long-term (200-day) EMAs, reinforcing a bullish outlook.\n\nIn summary, based on the technical setup and indicators such as the RSI and moving averages, buying KOTAKBANK at \u20b91,805.65 with a stop-loss at \u20b91,750 and a target of \u20b91,915 presents a compelling opportunity for potential gains.\n\n2] Muthoot Finance: Buy at \u20b9 1,875, target \u20b9 2,030, stop loss \u20b9 1,805 MUTHOOTFIN is currently experiencing a long-term uptrend, showing a bullish pattern with a consistent series of higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart. The stock is trading at \u20b91,875.3 levels and is on the verge of breaking out of a consolidation range. MUTHOOTFIN has formed a strong bullish candle supported by notable trading volumes, indicating a continuation of the uptrend. MUTHOOTFIN recently bounced from its support zones, and if it maintains its position above the \u20b91,900 level, it could likely continue its upward trajectory toward new highs.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 57.38 with a positive crossover, suggesting increasing buying momentum. Additionally, MUTHOOTFIN is trading above its key moving averages, including the short-term (20-day) EMA, medium-term (50-day) EMA, and long-term (200-day) EMA, which confirms the strength of the current uptrend.\n\nBased on these technical indicators, we recommend taking a long position in MUTHOOTFIN at \u20b91875.3. Set a stop loss at \u20b91,805 to manage risk, and aim for a target price of \u20b92,030, aligning with the current favourable market sentiment.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today 3] United Spirits Ltd: Buy at \u20b9 1,408, target \u20b9 1,465, stop loss \u20b9 1,370 In the recent short-term trend analysis of the stock, a notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged. This technical pattern suggests the possibility of a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around \u20b91,465. At present, the stock is maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b91,370. Given the current market price of around \u20b91,408, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors might consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b91465.\n\n4] Tata Power: Buy at \u20b9 422, target \u20b9 438, stop loss \u20b9 410 On the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the \u20b9422 price level has been observed, signalling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss at \u20b9410 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b9438 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.\n\nAlso Read | GIFT City regulator halts approvals for local families to invest abroad: Report",

The Nifty 50 index added 31 points and closed at 24,572; the BSE Sensex ended marginally lower at 80,424, whereas the Bank Nifty index corrected 148 points and finished at 50,368. However, the broad market outshines the frontline indices. The Small-cap index shot up 1.33 per cent, while the Mid-cap index surged 0.53 per cent.\n\nTrade setup for Tuesday On the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The short-term trend of Nifty continues to be positive. Having placed at the key overhead resistance around 24700, there is a possibility of some more consolidation or minor dip in the next 1-2 sessions before showing another round of upside breakout. Immediate support for Nifty today is placed at 24,400.\"\n\nOn the outlook for Bank Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"The Bank Nifty also opened with a gap up but failed to sustain higher levels, leading to profit booking. Consequently, the index ended the day on a negative note at 50,368. Technically, the Bank Nifty has formed a red candle on the daily chart, indicating weakness. The index could not cross the barrier of the 21-DEMA, located near 50,770, and the previous week's high was near 50,830 levels. A sustained move above 50,830 could propel the index towards the 51,200-51,500 range. Until then, the index is likely to consolidate within the band of 49,650-50,830.\"`\n\nUS Fed minutes \"As Meaket is waiting for the outcome of the Jackson Hole Symposium, US Fed minutes coming ahead of Jerome Powell's speech is also an important trigger that the market is looking at. So, I expect the range-bound movement to continue with positive bias maintained,\" said Avinash Gorakshkar, Head of Research at Profitmart Securities.\n\nStocks to buy today Regarding shares to buy today, stock market experts \u2014 Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi \u2014 recommended five intraday stocks for today.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stock recommendations today 1] Wipro: Buy at \u20b9519.75, target \u20b9560, stop loss \u20b9500.\n\nThe stock is displaying signs of resilience and potential upward momentum. Its ability to rebound from the robust support range of \u20b9480 to \u20b9485 indicates considerable buying interest within this price band. After a bounce back from the mentioned support levels, we have seen a decisive breakout above \u20b9500, which will act as solid support.\n\n2] Fiem Industries: Buy at \u20b91418.75, target \u20b91485, stop loss \u20b91365.\n\nFiem Industries' share is currently trading at \u20b91418.75. After minor falls and sideways consolidation, the stock has lately broken the neckline levels of \u20b91400 and is rising quickly on the upside with substantial volume. There are expectations of further upward movement, potentially reaching \u20b91485 levels. On the downside, considerable support is evident at nearly \u20b91365.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today 3] Kansai Nerolac Paints: Buy at \u20b9295, target \u20b9305, stop loss \u20b9290.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis. This technical pattern suggests a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around Rs. 305. The stock is currently maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b9290. Given the current market price of \u20b9295, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b9305.\n\n4] Godrej Properties: Buy at \u20b92930, target \u20b93050, stop loss \u20b92860.\n\nOn the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the \u20b92930 price level has been observed, signalling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss at \u20b92860 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b93050 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.\n\n5] Coal India: Buy at \u20b9522, target \u20b9535, stop loss \u20b9512.\n\nThis stock is forming an inherently bullish rounding bottom pattern on the short-term chart. Currently priced at \u20b9522, this formation signals a potential upward trend. To effectively manage risk, a stop loss of \u20b9512 is recommended.\n\nThe target price for this strategy is \u20b9535 in the upcoming weeks. This suggests a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory, backed by the bullish technical signals.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to US recession fear; five stocks to buy or sell on Friday \u2014 August 16\nStock market today: Despite strong global market sentiments on the US Fed rate cut buzz, the Indian stock market remained flat on Wednesday. The Nifty 50 index finished marginally higher at the 24,143 mark, the BSE Sensex went up 149 points and closed at 79,105, whereas the Bank Nifty index went off 104 points and ended at 49,727. Cash market volumes on the NSE were 8.1 per cent lower than the previous session. However, the broad market indices witnessed sharp selling as the small-cap index fell around 0.57 per cent, whereas the mid-cap index slipped around 0.41 per cent. The advance-decline ratio remained below 1:1 but rose to 0.52:1.\n\nTrade setup for Friday On the outlook for Nifty today, Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com, said, \"In last few trading sessions, Nifty has traded within a broader range where the index did witness a pullback move from 23900, but was also unable to surpass the hurdle of 24400-24450. Thus, the next directional move in the index would be seen on a breakout beyond this zone; hence, one should take positions for a trended move beyond this zone only. If the Nifty breaks the mentioned support, then we could see a down move towards 23630, the 38.2 per cent retracement level of the up move from the election results in the day low to the recent high. On the higher side, a breakout above 24450 will only lead to a resumption of the broader uptrend.\"\n\nOn the outlook for Bank Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"The Bank Nifty index opened marginally negative and remained under pressure throughout the day, closing negatively at 49,727 levels. Technically, the index formed a red candle on the daily scale, indicating continued weakness. However, the index is finding support near the 49,650-49,660 levels. A sustained move below 49,650 could push the index toward the 49,000 level.\"\n\nUS recession fear fades \"After the consumer price rebound report in the US CPI data on Wednesday, the US Fed rate cut hopes received a heavy dent. The market is expected to react negatively to this development. However, the fear of the US recession faded after the robust US job data on Thursday. Hence, some value buying is expected at the lower levels,\" said Avinash Gorakshkar, Head of Research at Profitmart Securities.\n\nStocks to buy today Regarding shares to buy today, stock market experts \u2014 Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager \u2014 Technical Research at Anand Rathi \u2014 recommended buying five stocks: HBL Power, Naukri, Titan, Tata Chemical, and Samvardhan Motherson.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stock recommendations for today 1] HBL Power: Buy at \u20b9634.40, target \u20b9686, stop loss \u20b9610.\n\nHBL Power share is trading around 634.4 levels and is in a consolidation phase. After reaching an all-time high, the stock has stabilised near its demand zone. Recently, HBL Power's share price witnessed a bounce back from \u20b9561, which was also its medium-term (50-day) EMA level, indicating a potential trend reversal. If the stock sustains above \u20b9640, it could continue its upward trajectory toward new highs.\n\n2] Naukri: Buy at \u20b97236.75, target \u20b97840, stop loss \u20b96960.\n\nNaukri is trading near its all-time high at \u20b97236.75, forming higher highs and lows on the daily chart. The stock has created a strong bullish candle supported by high trading volumes, indicating a continuation of the uptrend. Naukri recently bounced from its support zones, and if it maintains its position above \u20b97300, it could likely continue its upward trajectory toward new highs.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today 3] Tata Chemical: Buy at \u20b91020, target \u20b91060, stop loss \u20b9995.\n\nA significant bullish reversal pattern has been identified in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis. This technical pattern indicates the potential for a temporary upward retracement in the stock's price, with a possible target of around \u20b91060. Currently, the stock holds a critical support level of \u20b9995 while trading at a market price of \u20b91020. This setup presents a buying opportunity for investors, as the stock's price may rise towards the identified target of \u20b91060.\n\n4] Titan: Buy at \u20b93400, target \u20b93600, stop loss \u20b93350.\n\nOn the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the \u20b93400 price level has been observed, indicating the potential for an upward trend. This breakout is reinforced by the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is still trending upwards, signalling growing buying momentum. Based on these technical indicators, traders may consider buying on dips to enter the stock at a more favourable price point. Setting a stop loss at \u20b93350 is advisable to manage risk effectively. The target price for this strategy is \u20b93600 in the coming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward movement.\n\n5] Samvardhan Motherson: Buy at \u20b9184, target \u20b9195, stop loss \u20b9178.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis. This technical pattern suggests a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around \u20b9195. The stock is currently maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b9178. Given the current market price of \u20b9184, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b9195.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to Sensex, five stocks to buy or sell on Wednesday \u2014 August 14\nStock market today: Indian markets declined by approximately 1 percent, with the Sensex closing below the 79,000 level and the Nifty falling below 24,200, on Tuesday, August 12. This drop was largely due to a broad sell-off, especially in banking, metals, and auto stocks. Additionally, continued foreign fund outflows and mixed global market trends further dampened sentiment in domestic equities.\n\nTrade setup for Wednesday On the outlook for Nifty today, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities, said, \u201cBears have returned to the market as the index repeatedly failed to break above the 21 EMA. The near-term trend appears negative. On the upside, 24,250 now serves as a new resistance level, and as long as Nifty remains below 24,250, the strategy should be to sell on rallies. On the downside, initial support is around 24,000; if the index falls below this level, it may decline further towards 23,700.\u201d\n\nOn the overall market outlook, Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, said, \u201cNifty, after a lacklustre start, came under pressure and closed with a loss of 208 points at 24,139 levels. The broader market, too, saw a sell-off and was down 1%. Barring healthcare and consumer durables, all sectors ended in red. Domestic equities succumbed to global headwinds surrounding geopolitical uncertainty and cautiousness ahead of US inflation data. Healthy macro data back home failed to provide much-needed support. We expect the market to continue its consolidation mode due to lack of any major positive trigger. However, investors should use this dip as a buying opportunity in quality stocks, especially large-caps, where valuations are still comfortable.\u201d\n\nStocks to buy today Regarding intraday stocks for today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended these five buy or sell stocks: ICICI Securities, Fortis Healthcare, Power Grid Corporation of India, HCL Technologies and Tata Power.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stock recommendations 1] ICICI Securities: Buy at \u20b9 785.9, target \u20b9 850, stop loss \u20b9 755 ISEC is currently priced at 785.9 in the cash market, presenting a promising buying opportunity. On the daily chart, the stock appears to be on the verge of breaking out of a consolidation range. Strong trading volumes have supported the price, indicating strength in the move. If the price sustains above 790, it will likely advance towards a target of 850. On the downside, 755 will serve as immediate support.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 61.63 levels and trending upward, indicating an increase in buying momentum. Additionally, ISEC has rebounded from its key moving averages, including short-term (20-day) EMA and medium-term (50-day) EMA levels, signalling a bullish outlook.\n\nAlso Read | Odisha govt announces one-day menstrual leave for women in all jobs\n\nBased on these technical indicators, we recommend taking a long position in ISEC at 785.9, with a stop loss at 755 to manage risk, and a target price of 850, aligning with the current favorable market sentiment.\n\n2] Fortis Healthcare: Buy at \u20b9 517.1, target \u20b9 560, stop loss \u20b9 497 Fortis is currently in an upward trend, forming higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart. The stock is trading within a rising parallel channel and is consolidating near its historical peaks. It is showing signs of attempting to break through higher levels, supported by robust trading volumes reflecting the trend's strength. If Fortis surpasses the 530 mark, it could potentially advance towards a target of 560.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 64.48, with a positive crossover, indicating an increase in buying momentum. Additionally, Fortis has found support near its key moving averages, including the short-term (20-day) EMA and the medium-term (50-day) EMA, which supports the bullish trajectory.\n\nIn summary, based on the technical setup and indicators (RSI and moving averages), buying FORTIS at 517.1 levels with a stop-loss at 497 and a target price of 560, presents a compelling opportunity for potential gains.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 3] Power Grid Corporation of India: Buy at \u20b9 337, target \u20b9 350, stop loss \u20b9 330 A notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis. This technical pattern suggests the possibility of a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around Rs. 350. The stock is currently maintaining a crucial support level at Rs.330. A buying opportunity is emerging, given the current market price of Rs.337. This suggests that investors might consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of Rs. 350.\n\n4] HCL Technologies: Buy at \u20b9 1,592, target \u20b9 1,635, stop loss \u20b9 1,575 On the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the Rs. 1,592 price level has been observed, signalling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss at Rs. 1,575 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is Rs. 1,635 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.\n\nAlso Read | Muthoot Fin to Uno Minda\u2014SMC Global lists four stocks to bet on amid volatility\n\n5] Tata Power: Buy at \u20b9 408, target \u20b9 430, stop loss \u20b9 400 On the short-term chart, this stock is forming a rounding bottom pattern, which is inherently bullish. Currently priced at Rs. 408, this formation signals a potential upward trend. To effectively manage risk, a stop loss at Rs. 400 is recommended. .\n\nThe target price for this strategy is Rs. 430 in the upcoming weeks. This suggests a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory, backed by the bullish technical signals.",

Technically, the index has formed a hammer pattern on the weekly scale, indicating strength. If the index sustains above 50,710, it could trigger a fresh rally towards 51,000-51,200. Therefore, a buy-on-dips strategy should be adopted for Bank Nifty. On the downside, 49,650 will act as firm support for the index.\"\n\nHindenburg latest news Speaking on the outlook of the Indian stock market after Hindenburg Research allegations against the SEBI chief and her husband, Ambareesh Baliga, an Indian market expert said, \"There will be some impact, though one will after that need to watch out for whether fresh buying into the market comes at a lower level, as a support or not.\"\n\n\"Much will depend upon the kind of reaction opposition political parties give after the Hindenburg Research fresh claims,\" a SEBI registered equity research analyst said on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStocks to buy today Regarding intraday stocks for today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended these five buy or sell stocks: Tips Industries, Oil India Ltd, ICICI Bank, Laurus Labs, and DLF.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stock recommendations for today 1] Tips Industries: Buy at \u20b9716.35, target \u20b9755, stop loss \u20b9690.\n\nTips Industry's daily chart analysis of share price offers a favourable view for the following week, indicating a steady higher advance.

It has recently experienced a breakout from a consolidation phase. It has found support near its short-term (20-day) EMA, which indicates strong buying interest. This breakout, supported by strong trading volumes, suggests a robust bullish trend. If OIL maintains its position above the 650 level, it is well-positioned to move towards the upward target of \u20b9675.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 3] ICICI Bank: Buy at \u20b91180, target \u20b91210, stop loss \u20b91160.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis.

Among Sectors, IT and Metal indices lost the most and shed over 1.5 percent whereas some buying was seen in selective Media and Pharma stocks,\u201d said Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities.\n\n\u201cTechnically, market consistently facing selling pressure at higher levels. From the day's highest levels Nifty/ Sensex shed over 250/800 points. A bearish candle on daily charts and double top formation on intraday charts indicate further weakness from the current levels. For the day traders, intraday texture is non-directional and hence a level-based trading would be the ideal strategy,\u201d said Chouhan.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing global uncertainty is making market participants cautious, and short-term relief seems unlikely. The Nifty is encountering resistance around the 24,350 mark, and a decisive break below 23,900 could lead to a further decline. Traders are advised to adjust their positions with a hedged strategy to navigate the current volatility,\u201d said Ajit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking.\n\nAlso Read | These stock picks were no ticket to paradise\n\nFive stocks to buy or sell on Friday: As we look at intraday stocks, equity market expert Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager \u2014 Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommends the following five stocks to buy today: Century Plyboards, Manappuram Finance, IndusInd Bank, Hindustan Unilever, and HDFC Life Insurance.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stock recommendations today 1. Century Plyboards: Buy at \u20b9722.7, Target at \u20b9775, Stop loss at \u20b9697.\n\n\u201cCentury Ply is currently trading at 722.7 and has rebounded from support levels around 680, which is near its long-term (200-day) EMA. This bounce back indicates stability and suggests potential for further upward movement. The stock has also recently broken out from a falling trend line and successfully retested the breakout levels, validating the strength of the breakout,\u201d said Bagadia.\n\n\u201cThe momentum indicator RSI has also rebounded and is currently at 55.80, supporting the bullish outlook. Additionally, Century Ply is trading above its short-term (20-day) EMA and all major moving averages, highlighting its strength and bullish sentiment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGiven these technical indicators and overall market conditions, investors and traders might view this as a positive signal.

HDFC Life Insurance: Buy at \u20b9710.35, Target at \u20b9762, Stop loss at \u20b9684.\n\n\u201cHDFCLIFE is in a long-term uptrend, forming higher highs and higher lows on the daily time frame. The stock has recently experienced a pullback from its higher levels but has reversed from support areas, indicating that the bullish trend will continue. If the stock can hold above the \u20b9720 level on a closing basis, it is poised to move towards an upward target of \u20b9762 potentially,\u201d said Bagadia.\n\n\u201cThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 67.09 levels, indicating that the stock is not in an overbought condition and thus has room for further upward movement. Additionally, the stock has bounced from its short-term (20-day) Exponential Moving Average (EMA), signaling strong support at these levels,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGiven the current technical indicators and price action, HDFCLIFE appears well-positioned for a potential upward move. Investors should consider buying on dips, with a stop loss set at \u20b9684 to manage risk. The target price \u20b9762 aligns with resistance levels and offers a favorable risk-reward ratio, making this a promising trading opportunity,\u201d said the market expert.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today 3. Manappuram Finance: Buy at \u20b9198, Target at \u20b9205, Stop loss at \u20b9194.\n\nIn the recent short-term trend analysis of the stock, a notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged. This technical pattern suggests the possibility of a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around \u20b9205. At present, the stock is maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b9194.\n\nGiven the current market price of \u20b9198, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors might consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b9205.\n\n4. IndusInd Bank: Buy at \u20b91,348, Target at \u20b91,380, Stop loss at \u20b91,320.\n\nOn the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the \u20b91,348 price level has been observed, signalling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum.\n\nGiven these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss of \u20b91,320 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b91,380 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.\n\n5. Hindustan Unilever: Buy at \u20b92,735, Target at \u20b92,800, Stop loss at \u20b92,700.\n\nOn the short-term chart, this stock is forming a rounding bottom pattern, which is inherently bullish. Currently priced at \u20b92,735, this formation signals a potential upward trend. To effectively manage risk, a stop loss at \u20b92,700 is recommended.\n\nThe target price for this strategy is \u20b92,800 in the upcoming weeks. This suggests a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory, backed by the bullish technical signals.",

        "text": "Stock market strategy: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to India VIX, five stocks to buy or sell on Thursday \u2014 August 8\nStock market today: After showing sharp weakness on the rise on Tuesday, the Indian stock market shifted into a sustainable upside bounce on Wednesday. The Nifty 50 index finished 322 points upward at 24,315, whereas the BSE Sensex ended 874 points higher at 79,468. The Bank Nifty index gained 472 points and closed at 50,221. However, the broad market outperform the frontline indices. The small-cap index gained 2.39 per cent, while the mid-cap index surged 2.63 per cent.\n\nTrade setup for Thursday On the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The short-term trend of Nifty seems to have reversed on the upside. A follow-through move is required to consider this a short-term bottom reversal pattern. A decisive move above 24,400 could pull Nifty towards another resistance of 24,700 quickly. Immediate support for Nifty today is at 24,050.\"\n\nOn the outlook for Bank Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"The Bank Nifty index opened with a gap up and saw profit booking in the first half. However, a late recovery helped Bank Nifty conclude the day positively, at 50,119 levels. Technically, daily, the index has formed a homing pigeon candlestick pattern, a bullish reversal pattern. According to this pattern, if Bank Nifty sustains above yesterday's high of 50,690, it may experience fresh bullish momentum. Conversely, 49,650 will support the Banknifty in the short run.\"\n\nIndia VIX today According to Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, the India VIX Index has dipped around 14 per cent after skyrocketing on Monday this week. This could be possible as the Nifty 50 index has managed to sustain above its 50-DEMA support, placed at around 23,950 to 23,980. However, the Choice Broking expert said that Wednesday's rise in the Indian stock market would remain a relief rally until the India VIX Index comes below 12.\n\nStocks to buy today About intraday stocks, stock market expert Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, recommends the following four stocks to buy today: Alkem Laboratories, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, New India Assurance Company, Laurus Labs, and DLF.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stock recommendations today 1] Alkem Laboratories: Buy at \u20b95512.25, target \u20b95950, stop loss \u20b95300.\n\nAlkem Laboratories shares, currently trading at \u20b95512.25, have exhibited a notable rebound from a robust support base around \u20b95300, aligning closely with its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The stock's resilience at this support level is cheerful, emphasizing its capacity to move higher.\n\n2] HPCL: Buy at \u20b9397.20, target \u20b9425, stop loss \u20b9383.\n\nHPCL's share price is currently trading at \u20b9397.20 and seems to be on the verge of breaking out from a cup-and-handle pattern on the daily chart. The pattern is backed by a significant increase in trading volume, suggesting a potential breakout. If the price successfully closes above the \u20b9400 level, it has the potential to reach short-term targets of \u20b9425.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today 3] New India Assurance Company: Buy at \u20b9265, target \u20b9280, stop loss \u20b9255.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis.

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 and Sensex today; four stocks to buy or sell on Tuesday - August 6\nStock market today: The Indian stock market indices crashed on Monday, August 5, due to fears of a potential US recession. The BSE Sensex crashed 2.74 per cent or 2,222.55 points, and the Nifty 50 plunged 2.68 per cent or 662.10 after Monday's trading session.\n\nWall Street also slumped on Monday, wiping off $1.93 trillion of investors' wealth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 2.6%, the S&P 500 tanked 3.00%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.43%.\n\nTrade Setup for Tuesday On the outlook for Nifty today, Rajesh Bhosale, Equity Technical Analyst, Angel One noted that amid the broad-based sell-off, with the support levels breaking easily, the only relief came from prices holding near the 50 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) around 23,900.\n\n\u201cHowever, given the strong bearish momentum, this support may be breached in the coming sessions. Traders are advised to avoid attempting to catch the bottom in the short term and should use any rebounds to reduce long positions. In this scenario, 24,250 is seen as immediate resistance, while overcoming the bearish gap left today between 24,350 and 24,700 would be a daunting task,\u201d said Bhosale.\n\nOn the downside, he believes 23,900 followed by 23,600 (the 38.2% retracement of gains from the election day low) are immediate support levels. The key support would be around 23,400 - 23,300, aligning with the 89 EMA and the 50% retracement of the mentioned upmove.\n\n\u201cTraders should monitor these levels and adjust their trades accordingly. One of the key highlights of the day was India Vix spiked by 42% to surpass the 20 mark, expect the Volatility to remain on the higher side, so it is advisable to manage risk carefully and stay informed about global developments, as they are likely to influence our markets in the near term,\u201d said Bhosale.\n\nFour stocks to buy or sell on Tuesday: With regard to intraday stocks, stock market expert Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, recommends the following four stocks to buy today: Hindustan Unilever, Tata Consumer Products, Huhtamaki, and Dr. Lal PathLabs.\n\n1. Hindustan Unilever: Buy at \u20b92,720, Target at \u20b92,780, Stop loss at \u20b92,680.\n\nThe expert said the stock has seen strong support at the price level of \u20b92,680, technically retrenchment could be possible till \u20b92,780, holding the support level of \u20b92,680. This stock can bounce towards the level of \u20b92,780 in the short term, so traders can go with a stop loss of \u20b92,680 for the target price of \u20b92,780.\n\n2. Tata Consumer Products: Buy at \u20b91,197, Target at 1,230, Stop loss at \u20b91,180\n\nThe expert said that in the short-term trend analysis of the stock, a notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged. This technical pattern suggests the possibility of a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around \u20b91,230. The stock is currently maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b91,180. Given the current market price of \u20b91,197, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors might consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b91,230.\n\nAlso Read | Oil prices decline as strong US recession fears loom global markets\n\n3. Huhtamaki India: Buy at \u20b9425.65, Target at \u20b9445, Stop loss at \u20b9410\n\nBagadia said Huhtamaki India is exhibiting strong bullish momentum, currently trading at an all-time high of \u20b9444 levels. The recent breakout above the crucial resistance at \u20b9410 levels is a significant technical development, supported by robust trading volumes, reinforcing the strength in the stock. The breakthrough suggests a potential continuation of the upward trend, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.\n\nAdditionally, Huhtamaki India is trading above key moving averages, including the short-term (20 Day), medium-term (50 Day), and long-term (200 Day) EMAs, further affirming its bullish stance. The momentum indicator, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), is at 69.59 levels, he said.\n\nFor traders, keeping an eye on the strong support near 410 levels is advisable, as a breach of this level could signal a shift in sentiment. Overall, Huhtamaki India's current technical setup suggests a favourable environment for further upside potential, provided traders and investors remain vigilant to potential reversals and closely monitor key support and resistance levels, said Bagaria.\n\n4. Dr. Lal PathLabs: Buy at \u20b93,160.15, Target at \u20b93,310, Stop loss at \u20b93,040\n\nDr. Lal PathLabs shares have recently exhibited a robust breakout from the critical resistance zone of \u20b93,070 to \u20b93,125 on the daily chart, consolidating the move with higher highs and higher lows. This breakout is supported by a notable increase in trading volume, indicating strong bullish sentiment, said Bagadia.\n\nKey technical indicators, particularly the Relative Strength Index (RSI), emphasize the stock's positive momentum. The RSI not only signals positive trends but also aligns with the stock trading above crucial moving averages, including the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). This convergence underscores the sustained strength in Dr. Lal PathLabs price action, he said.\n\nIn summary, the decisive breakout, coupled with favourable volume and a positive alignment of key technical indicators, suggests a bullish outlook for Dr. Lal PathLabs. Traders and investors may find this analysis indicative of potential continued upward momentum in the stock, said Bagaria.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to global markets, five stocks to buy or sell on Monday \u2014 August 5\nStock market today: Following a sell-off in the global markets on renewed US recession fear, the Indian stock market snapped its five-day winning steak on Friday. The Nifty 50 index crashed 311 points and closed at 24,699. The BSE Sensex tanked 885 points and ended at 80,981, whereas the Bank Nifty index corrected 226 points and finished at 51,337. Cash market volumes on the NSE were down about 4 percent. The small-cap index fell less than the Nifty 50 index even as the advance-decline ratio was down to 0.59:1.\n\nTrade setup for Monday Speaking on the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The short-term trend of Nifty today is down, but the near-term uptrend status of the market is intact. There is a possibility of some more weakness in the coming sessions, down to 24,600 to 24,500, before showing any upside bounce from the lows. Immediate resistance for Nifty today is at 24,900.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"The Bank Nifty index opened negatively but witnessed buying interest at lower levels. However, the index settled negatively at 51,350 due to strong selling pressure. Technically, the index is still consolidating in the band of around 51,000-52,300. Thus, waiting for a decisive breakout of this range is advised, which will determine the further direction for the Bank Nifty.\"\n\nUS recession news \"After the higher jobless claim data in the US, fear of the US recession has renewed, leading to a sharp correction in the US stock market. On Friday last week, Wall Street witnessed a bloodbath, and Asian markets are under pressure today. In early morning deals on Monday, the Japanese Nikkei crashed over 5 percent, whereas other Asian bourses are also under pressure. This is expected to dominate the Indian stock market as well. We are expecting some weakness in the Indian stock market during morning deals,\" said Avinash Gorakshkar, Head of Research at Profitmart Securities.\n\nStocks to buy today Regarding intraday stocks for today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended these five buy or sell stocks: Ajanta Pharma, Akzo Nobel India, Samvardhan Motherson, GMDC, and Finolex Cables.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stock recommendations for today 1] Ajanta Pharma: Buy at \u20b92828.50, target \u20b92950, stop loss \u20b92725.\n\nAjanta Pharma daily chart analysis offers a favourable view for the following week, indicating a steady higher advance. Notably, the stock has produced a notable higher high and higher low pattern, and the company's recent upward swing has effectively violated the neckline, establishing a new week high. This breakthrough indicates the possibility of a significant follow-through upward increase in the stock price.\n\n2] Akzo Nobel India: Buy at \u20b93117.50, target \u20b93260, stop loss \u20b93005.\n\nAKZOINDIA has recently exhibited a robust breakout from the critical resistance zone of \u20b92955 to \u20b93010 on the daily chart, consolidating the move with higher highs and higher lows. This breakout is supported by a notable increase in trading volume, indicating strong bullish sentiment.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today 3] Samvardhan Motherson: Buy at \u20b9194, target \u20b9200, stop loss \u20b9188.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis. This technical pattern suggests a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around \u20b9200. The stock is currently maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b9188. Given the current market price of \u20b9194, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b9200 to \u20b9204.\n\n4] GMDC: Buy at \u20b9395, target \u20b9410, stop loss \u20b9388.\n\nOn the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the \u20b9395 price level has been observed, signalling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss of \u20b9388 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b9410 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.\n\n5] Finolex Cables: Buy at \u20b91535, target \u20b91585, stop loss \u20b91500.\n\nThis stock is forming an inherently bullish rounding bottom pattern on the short-term chart. Currently priced at \u20b91535, this formation signals a potential upward trend. To effectively manage risk, a stop loss at \u20b91500 is recommended.",

The Nifty 50 index decisively conquered the psychological 25,000 peak. The 50-stock index took just 24 sessions to scale the last 1,000 points.\n\nThe frontline index achieved this feat despite various challenges, such as FIIs' selling, the initial adverse reaction to the Union Budget, developments on the Hamas conflict, deepening US-China trade tensions, and uninspiring Q1FY25 results. The BSE Sensex finished 126 points higher at 81,867, while the Bank Nifty index ended 50 points higher at 51,603.\n\nTrade setup for Friday On the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \u201cThe crucial hurdle of 25,000 to 25,100 remains intact, and the Nifty was not able to break above this area decisively. Chances of further consolidation or minor dip are not ruled out in the short term. Immediate support for Nifty today is at 24,750.\u201d\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"The Bank Nifty index opened on a positive tone but witnessed profit booking at higher levels and ended the day on a flat to positive note at 51,564. Technically, the index is still consolidating in the band of around 51,000-52,300. Moreover, the Bank Nifty faces rejection from a falling trend line at 52,300 levels. Thus, 52,000-52,300 will serve as a resistance zone for the Bank Nifty, while 51,000 will act as strong support.\"\n\nQ1 results today A total of 93 listed companies will declare their Q1FY24 results today. Those 93 listed companies include Titan Company, LIC Housing Finance, Hindustan Zinc, Delhivery, Narayana Hrudayalaya, Computer Age Management Services or CAMS, IDFC, Shree Renuka Sugars, etc.\n\nStocks to buy today Regarding intraday stocks for today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended these five buy or sell stocks: Voltas, HDFC Bank, HUL, Aditya Birla Capital, and GMR Infra.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stock recommendations today 1] Voltas: Buy at \u20b91536.65, target \u20b91615, stop loss \u20b91500.\n\n2] HDFC Bank: Buy at \u20b91638.80, target \u20b91750, stop loss \u20b91585.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today 3] HUL: Buy at \u20b92715, target \u20b92800, stop loss \u20b92675.\n\n4] Aditya Birla Capital: Buy at \u20b9220, target \u20b9230, stop loss \u20b9215.\n\n5] GMR Infra: Buy at \u20b9102, target \u20b9112, stop loss \u20b996.",

The Nifty 50 index finished 121 points higher at 24,978. The BSE Sensex scaled 285 points north and closed at 81,741, whereas the Bank Nifty index was 121 points higher at 51,620. In the broad market, the mid-cap index outshined frontline indices of the Indian stock market. However, the small-cap index ended 0.14 percent lower than the previous session.\n\nTrade setup for Thursday Speaking on the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The short-term trend of Nifty continues to be choppy, but the near-term uptrend status remains intact. The chart pattern signals more consolidation or minor dip in the next 1-2 sessions before bouncing back from the lows. Immediate support is at 24,600. However, a decisive move above 25,100 is expected to bring bulls back into action.\"\n\nOn the outlook for Bank Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"The Bank Nifty index opened on a positive tone, maintained bullish momentum despite turbulence, and ended the day on a positive note at 51,553. Technically, the index faces rejection from a falling trend line at 52,300 levels. Thus, 52,000-52,300 will serve as a resistance zone for the Bank Nifty, while 51,000 will be strong support.\"\n\nUS Fed meeting outcome in focus On how the outcome of the US Fed meeting would impact the Indian stock market today, Amit Goel, Co-Founder and Chief Global Strategist at Pace 360, said, \"The US Fed Chief Jerome Powell conveying a high probability of a rate cut in its September meeting should have a positive impact on the Indian market. We see a high probability of Nifty opening with a gap-up post-US FED meeting and continuing its march beyond 25K levels.\"\n\nExpecting the bull trend on Dalal Street to continue, Ajit Mishra, SVP \u2014 Research at Religare Broking, said, \"Markets may extend their gains and potentially surpass the 25,000 milestone on the Nifty index.\"\n\nStocks to buy today Regarding intraday stocks for today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended these five buy or sell stocks: Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, ICICI Lombard, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Samvardhan Motherson, and Wipro.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stock recommendations today 1] Glenmark Pharmaceuticals: Buy at \u20b91468.75, target \u20b91535, stop loss \u20b91414.\n\nGlenmark Pharmaceuticals' daily chart analysis offers a favourable view for the following week, indicating a steady higher advance. Notably, the stock has produced a notable higher high and higher low pattern in the daily frame, and the company's recent upward swing has effectively violated the neckline, establishing a new week high. This breakthrough indicates the possibility of a significant follow-through upward increase in the stock price.\n\n2] ICICI Lombard: Buy at \u20b92008, target \u20b92100, stop loss \u20b91935.\n\nICICIGI is exhibiting bullish solid momentum, trading at an all-time high of \u20b92020. The recent breakout above the crucial resistance at \u20b92000 levels is a significant technical development supported by robust trading volumes, reinforcing the strength of the stock. The breakthrough suggests a potential continuation of the upward trend, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today 3] Kotak Maahindra Bank: Buy at \u20b91811, target \u20b91865, stop loss \u20b91780.\n\nThe stock found a substantial support level at \u20b91780, marking a crucial juncture in its recent trading. At \u20b91811, the stock has demonstrated a definitive reversal in price action, suggesting a potential continuation of its upward momentum. Traders keen on seizing this opportunity could consider buying and holding the stock, setting a prudent stop loss at \u20b91780. The anticipated target for this trade is \u20b91865, representing the next significant resistance level. This strategy positions traders favourably to capitalize on the stock's expected rally in the weeks ahead.\n\n4] Samvardhan Motherson: Buy at \u20b9196, target \u20b9204, stop loss \u20b9190.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis. This technical pattern suggests a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around \u20b9204. The stock is currently maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b9190. Given the current market price of \u20b9196, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b9204.\n\n5] Wipro: Buy at \u20b9523, target \u20b9545, stop loss \u20b9508.\n\nOn the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the \u20b9525 price level has been observed, signalling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss of \u20b9508 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b9545 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.",

The Nifty 50 opened at 24,839.40, slightly above its previous close of 24,836.10, and reached an intraday high of 24,971.75 and a low of 24,798.65. The BSE Midcap index increased by 0.27%, while the Smallcap index went up by 0.88%. Consequently, the total market capitalization of the companies listed on the BSE reached a record high of nearly \u20b9461 lakh crore.\n\nTrade setup for Wednesday Speaking on the outlook for the Nifty today, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities, \"The Nifty oscillated between 24,800 and 25,000 before closing on a flat note. It seems that the bulls are taking a breather following a rally from 24,200. The trend remains positive, with Put writers putting their weight at 24,800. Buy-on-dips might remain the flavor of the market until the Nifty falls decisively below 24,700. On the higher end, a move above 25,000 might open the gate towards 25,250.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, De further added, \"Bank Nifty encountered selling pressure around its 21-day EMA but managed to close above its rising channel breakout point. On the options front, active put writers at lower strike prices indicate strong support at the 51200 level. Consequently, the view for Bank Nifty is range-bound, with support at 51000 and resistance at 51800 and 52000 levels. A decisive breakout of these levels will determine the future direction of Bank Nifty.\"\n\nStocks to buy today Regarding intraday stocks for today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended these five buy or sell stocks: Gujarat Mineral Development Corpn, Jindal Steel And Power, Finolex Cables, Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals and Voltas.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stock recommendations today 1] Chambal Fertilisers: Buy at \u20b9 516.75 | Target Price: \u20b9 560 | Stop Loss: \u20b9 495 CHAMBLFERT is trading at 516.75 and has given a breakout of a falling trend line.

If CHAMBLFERT manages to hold 521 on a closing basis, it may reach an upside target of 560.\n\nThe RSI is at 57.26 levels, with a positive crossover, indicating an increase in the buying momentum. Additionally, CHAMBLFERT has bounced back from its medium-term (50-day) EMA and is trading above its short-term (20-day) EMA, reinforcing the bullish outlook.\n\nIn light of these technical indicators, we recommend entering a long position in CHAMBLFERT@ 516.75. With a clearly defined stop loss of 495 and a favorable target price of 560, this investment aligns well with the current positive market sentiment.\n\n2] VOLTAS: Buy at \u20b9 1543.95 | Target Price: \u20b9 1650 | Stop Loss: \u20b9 1490 VOLTAS is currently in an upward trend, consolidating near its historical peaks. The stock is showing signs of trying to break through higher levels, supported by notable trading volumes that reflect the strength of the trend. If VOLTAS manages to surpass the 1560 mark, it could potentially advance towards a target of 1650.\n\nThe RSI is at 62.21 levels, is trending upward and appears positive, indicating a potential increase in buying pressure. Moreover, VOLTAS is trading above its key moving averages, including the short-term (20 Day) and medium-term (50 Day) EMA levels, which confirms the strength of the current uptrend.\n\nIn summary, based on the technical setup and indicators (RSI and moving averages), buying VOLTAS at 1543.95 levels with a stop-loss at 1490 and a target price of 1650, presents a compelling opportunity for potential gains.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today 3] Gujarat Mineral Development Corpn: Buy at \u20b9 400 | Target Price: \u20b9 420 | Stop Loss: \u20b9 390 GMDCLTD has recently displayed a bullish trend with a significant breakout above Rs.400 on the daily chart. This breakout suggests strong upward momentum, making it an opportune time to consider initiating a buy position. By maintaining a stop-loss (SL) at Rs.390, investors can manage potential downside risks effectively. The target price for this investment is set at Rs.420, indicating a potential upside from the current levels.\n\n4] Jindal Steel And Power: Buy at \u20b9 979 | Target Price: \u20b9 1010 | Stop Loss: \u20b9 950 In the short-term trend, the stock has seen a strong support at price level of 950, technically retrenchment could be possible till Rs.1010 so, holding the support level of Rs.950 this stock can bounce toward the level Rs.1010 in the short term, so the trader can go along with a stop loss of Rs.950 for the target price of Rs.1010.\n\n5] Finolex Cables: Buy at \u20b9 1580 | Target Price: \u20b9 1640 | Stop Loss: \u20b9 1530 On the daily chart, the stock has shown a short-term reversal pattern. Specifically, a bullish engulfing pattern has formed, which is a strong indicator of potential upward movement. This technical pattern is considered bullish in nature, suggesting that the stock may experience a rise in price. Given this setup, traders might consider buying this stock, setting a stop loss at Rs. 1530 to manage risk. The target price for this trade is Rs. 1640, providing an opportunity for gains as the stock continues to demonstrate bullish behavior.",

The Nifty 50 index ended almost flat at the 24,416 mark; the BSE Sensex lost 109 points and closed at 80,039, whereas the Bank Nifty index crashed 423 points and finished at 50,893. Cash market volumes on the NSE were about 6 percent lower than the previous day. The broad market indices aligned with the Nifty even as the advance-decline ratio fell to 0.94:1.\n\nTrade setup for Friday On the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The short-term trend of Nifty continues to be choppy. The lacklustre movement with weak bias is expected to continue for the next 1-2 sessions before witnessing a sharp upside bounce from the lows. Important lower supports should be watched around 24100-24000 levels, which could be a buy-on-dips opportunity. Immediate resistance is placed at 24500.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"The Bank Nifty index opened on a negative note and remained under pressure throughout the day. As a result, Bank Nifty settled the day on a negative note at 50,889 levels. Technically, the index on a daily scale has formed a tiny green candle but failed to close above the 51,100 level, indicating weakness. As long as the index holds below 51,100, weakness will likely continue. On the downside, 50,500 and 50,000 will act as support levels.\"\n\nQ1 results today A total of 67 listed companies will declare their Q1 results 2024. These companies include Power Grid Corporation, Interlobar Aviation or IndiGo, Cipla, IndusInd Bank, Shriram Finance, SBI Card, Bandhan Bank, KEC International, Sanofi India, etc.\n\nStocks to buy today Regarding intraday stocks for today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended these five buy or sell stocks: Laurus Labs, LIC Housing Finance, Balkrishna Industries, IndiGo, and Zydus Life.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stock recommendations today 1] IndiGo: Buy at \u20b94432.20, target \u20b94790, stop loss \u20b94250.\n\nIndiGo's share price is currently trading near its all-time high of \u20b94432.20.

The stock has rebounded from its support levels, notably its short-term (20-Day) EMA, and is currently trading at \u20b91205.80, indicating a strong potential to reach the upside target of \u20b91305 levels in the near term.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today 3] Laurus Labs: Buy at \u20b9435, target \u20b9450, stop loss \u20b9425.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis. This technical pattern suggests a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around \u20b9450. The stock is currently maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b9425. Given the current market price of Rs.435, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b9450.\n\n4] LIC Housing Finance: Buy at \u20b9768, target \u20b9795, stop loss \u20b9750.\n\nIn the short term, the stock has seen a bullish reversal pattern. Technically, retrenchment could be possible until \u20b9795. So, with the support of \u20b9750, this stock can bounce toward \u20b9795 in the short term.

The Nifty 50 index slipped 40 points and closed at the 24,438 mark, the BSE Sensex shed 280 points and closed at 80,148, while the Bank Nifty index finished 348 points at 51,429. Cash market volumes fell 19 percent to \u20b91.37 lakh crore. The broad market indices ended positively, even as the advance-decline ratio rose sharply to 3.26:1.\n\nTrade setup for Thursday On the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The short-term trend for Nifty today continues to be weak. Further weakness from here could find lower supports around 24,270-24,100, and one may expect the emergence of buying from the lows. Immediate hurdles to be watched around 24,580.\"\n\nOn the outlook for Bank Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"The Bank Nifty index opened on a negative note and remained under pressure in the first half. However, the index recovered in the second half, mitigating some losses. As a result, Bank Nifty settled the day on a negative note at 51,317 levels. Technically, the index on a daily scale has retested its previous breakout from the rounding bottom pattern and managed to close above it. Moreover, the index has respected the 50-DEMA support, which is near 50,950. A short-term relief rally cannot be ruled out as long as the index holds above the 51,000-50,950 levels. However, sustaining below 50,950 will trigger fresh weakness for the Bank Nifty.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Indian stock market today, Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal, said, \"We anticipate the market to quickly discount the budget and shift its focus to the trajectory of corporate earnings growth, which has remained marginally below our expectations so far in 1QFY25. Thus, we expect the market to consolidate in the near term.\"\n\nStocks to buy today Regarding intraday stocks for today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended these five buy or sell stocks: Tech Mahindra, Mahanagar Gas Ltd or MGL, DLF, IndiGo, and Jindal Steel.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stock recommendations today 1] Tech Mahindra: Buy at \u20b91533.30, target \u20b91650, stop loss \u20b91475.\n\nTech Mahindra share has formed a strong bullish candle on its daily chart, indicating substantial buying interest while trading near its all-time highs. After a strong upward movement, the stock has entered a consolidation phase after reaching its peak. It has notably found support near the short-term (20-day) Exponential Moving Average (EMA), suggesting a period of stability in its price action.\n\n2] MGL: Buy at \u20b91751, target \u20b91890, stop loss \u20b91680.\n\nMGL share price is currently trading at \u20b91751, has broken out of its recent sideways trading range. This breakout suggests a shift in momentum towards a potential bullish trend. The price action indicates that MGL is moving beyond the consolidation phase, which typically signifies renewed buying interest and potential upward movement in the stock.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today 3] DLF: Buy at \u20b9818, target \u20b9850, stop loss \u20b9805.\n\nIn the short term, the stock has seen a bullish reversal pattern. Technically, retrenchment could be possible until \u20b9850. So, holding the support level of \u20b9805, this stock can bounce toward \u20b9850 in the short term.

The Indian stock market benchmarks dropped nearly 2 per cent during the session in response to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's budget announcement of increases in the Security Transactions Tax (STT), long-term capital gains tax (LTCG), and short-term capital gains tax (STCG).\n\nAfter the Finance Minister's announcements regarding capital gains taxes, the Sensex dropped 1,278 points, or 1.6%, to the day's low of 79,224.32. Meanwhile, the Nifty 50 tumbled 435 points, or 1.8%, to the day's low of 24,074.20 during Tuesday's session.

The Relative Strength Index (14) has entered a bearish crossover and is exiting the overbought zone. The 24,550 level is likely to act as an immediate hurdle for Nifty. A move above 24,550 might induce a meaningful rally in the Nifty, while support is placed at 24,480. A decisive fall below 24,480 might induce selling pressure in the market.\"\n\nOn the outlook of Bank Nifty, De further added, \u201cThe index experienced a correction during the day due to weakness in the market. Additionally, the index slipped below the 21-day exponential moving average, indicating a weakening trend. Sentiment might remain weak in the short term or until the index stays below 52,100. On the lower end, it might move towards 51,200\u201351,000. On the higher end, resistance is placed at 52,100/52,550.\u201d\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Regarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommend buying these five buy-or-sell stocks: IPCA Laboratories Ltd, Cochin Shipyard, Max Financial Services, TTK Prestige and Zydus Lifesciences.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 1] IPCA Laboratories Ltd: Buy at \u20b9 1,240 | Target Price: \u20b9 1,280 | Stop Loss: \u20b9 1,210 On the daily chart, the stock has shown a short-term reversal pattern. Specifically, a bullish engulfing pattern has formed, a strong indicator of potential upward movement. This technical pattern is considered bullish, suggesting that the stock may experience a price rise. Given this, traders might consider buying this stock, setting a stop loss at \u20b91,210 to manage risk. The target price for this trade is \u20b91,280, providing an opportunity for gains as the stock continues to demonstrate bullish behaviour.\n\n2] Cochin Shipyard: Buy at \u20b9 2,600 | Target Price: \u20b9 2,690 | Stop Loss: \u20b9 2,540 In the short-term trend, the stock has seen a bullish reversal pattern, and technically, retrenchment could be possible till \u20b92680. So, holding the support level of \u20b92,540, this stock can bounce toward the level \u20b92,690 in the short term, so the trader can go along with a stop loss of \u20b92,540 for the target price of Rs.2690.\n\n3] Max Financial Services Ltd: Buy at \u20b9 1,040 | Target Price: \u20b9 1,080 | Stop Loss: \u20b9 1,010 In the recent short-term trend analysis of the stock, a notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged. This technical pattern suggests the possibility of a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around \u20b91,080.

The recent breakout above the crucial resistance at 900 levels is a significant technical development, supported by robust trading volumes, reinforcing the strength of the stock. The breakthrough suggests a potential continuation of the upward trend, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.\n\nAdditionally, TTK Prestige is trading above key moving averages, including the short-term (20-Day), medium-term (50-Day), and long-term (200-Day) EMAs, further affirming its bullish stance. The momentum indicator, Relative Strength Index (RSI), is at 80.76 levels.\n\nFor traders, keeping an eye on the strong support near 880 levels is advisable, as a breach of this level could signal a shift in sentiment. Overall, TTK Prestige's current technical setup suggests a favourable environment for further upside potential, provided traders and investors remain vigilant to potential reversals and closely monitor key support and resistance levels.\n\nBased on the above analysis we recommend buying TTK Prestige at 914.8 with a stop loss of 880 and a target of 960.\n\n5] Zydus Lifesciences: Buy at \u20b9 2,277.15 | Target Price: \u20b9 2,380 | Stop Loss: \u20b9 2,190 ZYDUSWELL daily chart analysis offers a favourable view for the following week, indicating a steady higher advance.

The stock formed a strong bullish sentiment signifying a potential continuation of the uptrend following and the daily strength indicator RSI (14) is moving upwards and positioned above its reference line, indicating a positive bias. Furthermore, ZYDUSWELL is currently trading above its crucial 20-day, 50-day, and 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) levels, reinforcing the bullish trend. Given the overall chart pattern, the analysis suggests a favourable long trading opportunity for investors.\n\nBased on the above analysis we recommend buying ZYDUSWELL in cash at CMP of 2,277.15 for a target of 2,380 with a stop loss of 2,190.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50, Q1 results today to Budget 2024, five stocks to buy or sell on Monday\nStock market today: After a sharp move on Thursday, the Indian stock market witnessed a decisive selloff on Friday last week. Stock market experts believe the selloff on Dalal Street was caused by weak global market trends and rising US-China tension. The Nifty 50 index corrected 269 points and closed at 24,530, while the BSE Sensex lost 738 points and ended at 80,604. The Bank Nifty index nosedived 355 points and finished at 52,265. Cash market volumes on the NSE were down 8.8 percent, hindered by tech outages. The broad market indices fell more than the Nifty even as the advance-decline ratio fell to 0.18:1, the lowest in 1.5 months.\n\nTrade setup for Monday On the outlook of Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The short-term trend of Nifty seems to have reversed from the all-time highs. The formation of candle patterns as daily and weekly indicates the possibility of more weakness in the market ahead. The next lower supports to be watched are around 24,200 and 24,000. Immediate resistance for Nifty today is placed at 24,850.\"\n\nOn the outlook of Bank Nifty today, Om Mehra, Technical Analyst at SAMCO Securities, said, \"Bank Nifty ended the session at 52,265.60, down by 0.67%. Bank Nifty formed a bearish harami pattern on the daily candle which indicates short-term weakness. Bank Nifty is near its support zone, around 52,100; if this level is broken on a closing basis, it could extend towards the 51,700 zone. With the daily MACD indicator slightly skewed to the negative side, a sell-on-rise strategy would be suitable for the short term.\"\n\nBudget 2024 in focus Speaking on the outlook for the Indian stock market today, Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal, said, \"Overall markets got impacted due to new tensions between US and China, which resulted in global profit booking. In addition, Microsoft's outage impacted a lot of large organizations, airlines, and stock exchanges globally. Investors are also cautious ahead of Union Budget 2024 this week on 23rd July, which will provide the next direction to the market. Earnings season will also pick up pace, resulting in stock-specific actions. Besides the Budget 2024, US Core PCE and PMI data will be key events to monitor.\"\n\nQ1 results today Forty-four companies listed on the Indian bourses will declare their Q1 2024 results on Monday. Those companies include IOB, IDBI Bank, Suzlon Energy, UCO Bank, Coforge, Zensar Technologies, Jana Small Finance Bank, and Cyient DLM.\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Regarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommend buying these five buy-or-sell stocks: Kalyan Jewellers, Emami, HCL Technologies, Ashok Leyland, and Max Financial Services Ltd or MFSL.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Kalyan Jewellers: Buy at \u20b9526, target \u20b9565, stop loss \u20b9505.\n\nKalyan Jewellers share price has broken out of its consolidation phase and is trending upwards with higher highs and higher lows, signalling strong bullish momentum. Recent candles show minimal lower wicks, indicating robust buyer control. Increased volume supports the breakout, suggesting the stock may continue upward if it maintains its current trajectory above recent highs.\n\n2] Emami: Buy at \u20b9800, target \u20b9860, stop loss \u20b9765.\n\nEmami share currently displays bullish continuation patterns, rebounds from support levels, and then makes upward solid moves.

The Nifty 50 index gained 187 points and finished at a record closing high of 24,800. The BSE Sensex finished 626 points northward at 81,343, while the Bank Nifty index ended 223 points up at 52,620.

The immediate support of the 10-day EMA continued to offer support during consolidations. Nifty is now advancing towards a key overhead resistance of 24,960. Hence, one may expect volatility/consolidations around 24950-25000 in the short term.\"\n\nOn the outlook for Bank Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \u201cBank Nifty index opened gap down, remained under pressure in the first half, but after that witnessed a strong recovery and finally settled the day on a positive note at 52,621 levels. Technically, on the daily scale, the index defended the 21-DEMA support of 52,020 levels. As long as the index holds above 52,000 levels, the ongoing bullish momentum will continue for Bank Nifty. On the upside, 52,800 and 53,000 will serve as strong resistance levels.\u201d\n\nOn the outlook for the Indian stock market today, Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal, said, \"We expect this ongoing momentum to continue with stock-specific action. All eyes will be on the budget next week, which could set the tone for the next leg of the market rally.\"\n\nQ1 results today A total of 46 Dalal Street heavyweights will declare their Q1 results 2024 on Friday. Those 46 listed companies include Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Wipro, JSW Steel, BPCL, JSW Energy, One 97 Communications or Paytm, Union Bank of India, ICICI Lombard, Indian Hotels Company, Oberoi Realty, etc.\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Regarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommend buying these five buy-or-sell stocks: Mphasis, Finolex Industries, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), Bharti Airtel, and Cholamandalam Investment and Finance.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Mphasis: Buy at \u20b92833.25, target \u20b92975, stop loss \u20b92735.\n\nMphasis daily chart analysis offers a favourable view for the following week, indicating a steady higher advance. Notably, the stock has produced a notable higher high and higher low pattern, and the company's recent upward swing has effectively violated the neckline, establishing a new week high. This breakthrough indicates the possibility of a significant follow-through upward increase in the stock price.\n\n2] Finolex Industries: Buy at \u20b9331.70, target \u20b9355, stop loss \u20b9318.\n\nFinolex Industries share has recently experienced a significant breakout from a falling parallel channel, indicating a continuation of its positive trend. This breakout is substantial as it is supported by high trading volumes, demonstrating robust momentum and strength in the current price movement.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 3] M&M: Buy at \u20b92820, target \u20b92920, stop loss \u20b92760.\n\nOn the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the Rs.2820 price level has been observed, signalling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss of \u20b92760 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b92920 in the near term, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.\n\n4] Bharti Airtel: Buy at \u20b91480, target \u20b91520, stop loss \u20b91455.\n\nOn the daily chart, the stock has shown a short-term reversal pattern. Specifically, a bullish engulfing pattern has formed, a strong indicator of potential upward movement. This technical pattern is considered bullish, suggesting that the stock may experience a price rise. Given this setup, traders might consider buying this stock, setting a stop loss at \u20b91455 to manage risk. The target price for this trade is \u20b91520, providing an opportunity for gains as the stock continues to demonstrate bullish behaviour.\n\n5] Cholamandalam Investment and Finance: Buy at \u20b91450, target \u20b91490, stop loss \u20b91425.\n\nIn the short term, the stock has seen a bullish reversal pattern. Technically, retrenchment could be possible until \u20b91490. So, holding the support level of \u20b91425, this stock can bounce toward \u20b91490 in the short term. Hence, the trader can use a stop loss of \u20b91425 for the target price of \u20b91490.",

The Nifty 50 index closed 26 points higher at 24,613, the BSE Sensex gained 51 points and ended at 80,716, whereas the Bank Nifty index finished 59 points lower at 52,396. Cash market volumes on the NSE were 5.1 percent lower at \u20b91.25 lakh crore. The mid-cap index ended negatively even as the advance-decline ratio remained above par at 1.05:1.\n\nTrade setup for Thursday On the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The near-term uptrend of Nifty remains intact. Though Nifty is consolidating at higher levels, there is still no confirmation of any significant reversal pattern building at the highs. Further upside move from here could pull Nifty towards 24,900 in the near term. The immediate support for Nifty today is at 24,450 levels.\"\n\nOn the outlook for Bank Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"Bank Nifty index opened adversely, consolidated in a narrow zone, and finally settled the day on a negative note at 52,397 levels. Technically, on the daily scale, the index consolidates in a narrow band but holds above the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) support, which is positioned near 51,960. At the same time, the recent swing low is situated near 51,750. As long as the index holds above 51,750, a buy-on-dips strategy should be adopted for Bank Nifty. On the upside, 52,800 and 53,000 will serve as strong resistance levels.\"\n\nQ1 results today A total of 34 listed companies will declare their Q1 results 2024. Those listed companies include Infosys, Havells India, Polycab India, JSW Infra, Tata Communications, Persistent Systems, Tata Technologies, Dalmia Bharat, Tanla Platforms, MAstek, South Indian Bank, Rallis India, etc.\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Regarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommend buying these five buy-or-sell stocks: Suzlon, Tech Mahindra, Jindal Steel, Adani Total Gas, and Siemens.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Suzlon: Buy at \u20b955.70, target \u20b960, stop loss \u20b953.90.\n\nThe SUZLON share is currently trading at \u20b955.70. The stock recently broke out of a rounding pattern with good volume, indicating a strong uptrend.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) for the SUZLON share price stands at 67.4, suggesting there is still room for potential upside. Additionally, the Stochastic RSI shows a positive crossover, further supporting the bullish sentiment. Notably, the stock is trading above all major moving averages, highlighting its strength in the market.\n\nConsidering these technical indicators and the prevailing market conditions, the current level of \u20b955.70 presents a favourable buying opportunity for SUZLON. The trade target is \u20b960, with a recommended stop-loss of \u20b953.9 to manage potential risks.\n\n2] Tech Mahindra: Buy at \u20b91515, target \u20b91620, stop loss \u20b91450.\n\nTech Mahindra Share, a prominent player in the technology sector, has demonstrated resilience by bouncing back after a retest of the breakout level at \u20b91485. Currently trading at \u20b91515 per share, the stock has recently broken above \u20b91485, signalling robust strength. This positive sentiment is further reinforced as TECHM trades above its 20, 50, and 200-day moving averages, indicating bullish momentum.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 3] Jindal Steel: Buy at \u20b91010, target \u20b91050, stop loss \u20b9992.\n\nThis stock forms an inherently bullish rounding bottom pattern on the daily chart. Currently priced at \u20b91010, this formation signals a potential upward trend. To effectively manage risk, a stop loss of \u20b9992 is recommended. Setting a stop loss at \u20b9992 helps limit potential downside risk while allowing the stock to fluctuate naturally.\n\nThe target price for this strategy is \u20b91050 in the upcoming weeks. This suggests a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory, backed by the bullish technical signals.\n\n4] Adani Total Gas: Buy at \u20b9906, target \u20b9950, stop loss \u20b9880.\n\nThe stock has formed a triple bottom pattern on the daily chart, a bullish technical pattern indicating a potential short-term reversal. This formation occurs when the stock price hits the same support level three times, creating a clear and distinct support zone. Adding to this bullish sentiment, a bullish engulfing pattern has emerged. It is a strong indicator of potential upward movement, signalling that buying pressure is starting to overcome selling pressure. Given this technical setup, traders might consider buying this stock. To manage risk effectively, setting a stop loss at \u20b9880 is prudent. The target price for this trade is set at \u20b9950.\n\n5] Siemens: Buy at \u20b97470, target \u20b97900, stop loss \u20b97350.\n\nIn the short-term trend, the stock has seen strong support at the price level of \u20b97300 to \u20b97350; technically, a reduction could be possible till \u20b97900. So, holding the support level of \u20b97350, this stock can bounce toward the level of \u20b97900 in the short term. Hence, the trader can go along with a stop loss of \u20b97300 for the target price of \u20b97900.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to Q1 results today, five stocks to buy or sell on Tuesday \u2014 July 16\nStock market today: Despite mixed trends from the global markets, the Indian stock market ended higher on Monday. The Nifty 50 index gained 84 points and closed at the 24,586 mark; the BSE Sensex shot up 145 points and finished at 80,664, whereas the Bank Nifty index ended 177 points higher at 52,455. Cash market volumes on the NSE were 15.5 percent lower at \u20b91.32 lakh crore. The mid-cap index outperformed the Nifty 50 index in the broad market even as the advance-decline ratio improved to 1.09:1. Most sectors ended in the green, with buying seen in PSU Bank, Oil & Gas, Realty, and Healthcare. PSU's Banking sector was up 3 per cent after media reports suggested that the government may introduce amendments to the Banking Regulation Act 1949 and other laws to push reforms during the upcoming Budget session.\n\nTrade setup for Tuesday On the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The near-term trend of Nifty remains positive. Having sustained above the hurdle of 24,400 levels (1.618% Fibonacci extension), there is a higher possibility of a further gradual upside move in Nifty towards 24,950 in the next week. Immediate support for Nifty today is at 24,450.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Om Mehra, Technical Analyst at SAMCO Securities, said, \"Bank Nifty ended the session at 52,455.90, gaining 177 points or 0.34%. It continues to trade in a narrow range but remains above the crucial support 52,000. However, the index would weaken if it slips below 51,750, where the support of the rising trend line lies. Moving above 52,800 would resume the bullish trend. The primary trend remains positive, and any short-term correction is seen as a buying opportunity for the next session.\"\n\nQ1 results 2024 Twenty-three listed companies will declare their Q1 results today. These include Bajaj Auto, L&T Finance, CRISIL, Alok Industries, Jubilant Ingrevia, Just Dial, Agro Tech Foods, BMW Industries, Aditya Birla Money, and others.\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Regarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended buying these five buy-or-sell stocks: UTI AMC, Oracle Financial Services Software or OFSS, Max Financial Services, KFin Technologies, and Bajaj Auto.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stock recommendations today 1] UTI AMC: Buy at \u20b91077, target \u20b91130, stop loss \u20b91040.\n\nUTIAMC daily chart analysis offers a favourable view for the following week, indicating a steady higher advance. Notably, the stock has produced a notable higher high and higher low pattern, and the company's recent upward swing has effectively violated the neckline, establishing a new week high. This breakthrough indicates the possibility of a significant follow-through upward increase in the stock price.\n\n2] OFSS: Buy at \u20b910922.75, target \u20b911500, stop loss \u20b910555.\n\nOFSS has recently exhibited a robust breakout from the critical resistance zone of \u20b910050 to \u20b910550 on the daily chart. This breakout is supported by a notable increase in trading volume, indicating strong bullish sentiment.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 3] Max Financial Services: Buy at \u20b91037, target \u20b91080, stop loss \u20b91010.\n\nOn the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the \u20b91037 price level has been observed, signalling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss of \u20b91010 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b91080 in the near term, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.\n\n4] KFin Technologies: Buy at \u20b9756, target \u20b9785, stop loss \u20b9735.\n\nOn the daily chart, the stock has shown a short-term reversal pattern. Specifically, a bullish engulfing pattern has formed, a strong indicator of potential upward movement. This technical pattern is considered bullish, suggesting that the stock may experience a price rise. Given this setup, traders might consider buying this stock, setting a stop loss at \u20b9735 to manage risk. The target price for this trade is \u20b9785, providing an opportunity for gains as the stock continues to demonstrate bullish behaviour.\n\n5] Bajaj Auto: Buy at \u20b99675, target \u20b99950, stop loss \u20b99500.\n\nIn the short term, the stock has seen a bullish reversal pattern. Technically, retrenchment could be possible until \u20b99950. So, holding the support level of \u20b99500, this stock can bounce toward \u20b99950 in the short term. Hence, a trader can use a stop loss of \u20b99500 for the target price of \u20b99950.",

The Nifty 50 index finished 186 points higher at 24,502. The BSE Sensex shot up 622 points and closed at 80,519, whereas the Bank Nifty index ended marginally higher at 52,278.

The broad market indices ended negatively even as the advance-decline ratio fell to 0.67:1.\n\nTrade set up for Monday On the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The short-term trend of Nifty remains positive.

However, it erased most gains in the second half, settling the day flat at 52,279. Technically, the index formed a doji candle daily near the 21-day EMA support. If the index holds above 51,750, a buy-on-dips strategy should be adopted in Bank Nifty. On the upside, 52,800 and 53,000 will serve as strong resistance levels.\"\n\nQ1 results 2024 today Thirty listed companies on Dalal Street will declare their Q1 results today.

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to Q1 results today, five stocks to buy or sell on Friday \u2014 July 12\nStock market today: Despite strong global market sentiments, the Indian stock market traded sideways and ended flat on Thursday. The Nifty 50 index ended marginally lower at 24,315, while the BSE Sensex shed 24 points and finished at 79,897. The Bank Nifty index gained 81 points and closed at 52,270. After rising for three straight sessions, the India VIX Index crashed over 3 percent and ended at 14 mark.\n\nTrade setup for Friday On the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The underlying trend of Nifty remains choppy with positive bias. A sustainable move above 24,500 is expected to open the next upside target of 24,900 soon. The immediate support for Nifty today is at 24,150.\"\n\nOn the outlook for Bank Nifty today, Om Mehra, Technical Analyst at SAMCO Securities, said, \u201cBank Nifty ended the session at 52,270.65, up 0.16%. On the daily time frame, Bank Nifty has formed a long-legged Doji, indicating indecision in the short term. The index has slipped below its 10-day moving average (DMA), and the hourly chart displays lower lows and lower highs, suggesting a bearish trend. The immediate support level stands at 52,000, which aligns with the 20 DMA. Weakness is expected to persist if the index slips below 51,900. Conversely, breaking through the resistance at 52,530 could drive the index toward the 53,000-53,200 zone.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the outlook for the Indian stock market today, Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research at Motilal Oswal, said, \"Markets are trading sideways without any fresh triggers and inflation data due to release. However, sector and stock-specific actions continue as we enter into Q1 results season and ahead of the union budget. Markets today will react to US inflation data released on Thursday. The IT sector will be focused as TCS Q1 results align with expectations. At the same time, the commentaries will be keenly monitored. Overall strength is seen in the market as every dip is being bought, supported by strong domestic flows aided by FIIs buying in the last few days.\"\n\nQ1 results today Eleven listed companies on the Indian stock market will declare their Q1 results 2024 on Friday. These include HCL Technologies, the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA), Oriental Hotels, Vipul, and Setco Automotive.\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Regarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended buying these five buy-or-sell stocks: CESC, CMS Info Systems, Ashok Leyland, SBI, and Affle India.\n\n1] CESC: Buy at \u20b9192, target \u20b9201, stop loss \u20b9185.\n\nThe daily chart analysis of CESC reveals a promising outlook for the upcoming week, signalling a sustained upward movement. Notably, the stock has formed a significantly higher high and higher low pattern, and the recent upward swing has successfully breached the neckline, establishing a new week high for the stock. This breakout suggests the potential for a substantial follow-through upward movement in the stock price.\n\n2] CMS Info Systems: Buy at \u20b9527.30, target \u20b9555, stop loss \u20b9510.\n\nCMS Info Systems share is exhibiting bullish solid momentum, trading at an all-time high of \u20b9532. This breakout has been accompanied by a consolidation of the upward movement, characterized by higher highs and higher lows, supported by robust trading volumes, reinforcing the strength of the stock. The breakthrough suggests a potential continuation of the upward trend, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 3] Ashok Leyland: Buy at \u20b9227, target \u20b9238, stop loss \u20b9222.\n\nOn the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the \u20b9227 price level has been observed, signalling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss of \u20b9222 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b9238 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.\n\n4] State Bank of India or SBI: Buy at \u20b9857, target \u20b9890, stop loss \u20b9834.\n\nOn the daily chart, the stock has shown a short-term reversal pattern. Specifically, a bullish engulfing pattern has formed, a strong indicator of potential upward movement. This technical pattern is considered bullish, suggesting that the stock may experience a price rise. Given this setup, traders might consider buying this stock, setting a stop loss at \u20b9834 to manage risk. The target price for this trade is \u20b9890, providing an opportunity for gains as the stock continues to demonstrate bullish behaviour.\n\n5] Affle India: Buy at \u20b91410, target \u20b91450, stop loss \u20b91375.\n\nIn the short term, the stock has seen a bullish reversal pattern. Technically, retrenchment could be possible until \u20b91450. So, holding the support level of \u20b91375, this stock can bounce toward \u20b91450 in the short term. Hence, the trader can use a stop loss of \u20b91375 for the target price of \u20b91450.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to Q1 results 2024, five stocks to buy or sell on Thursday \u2014 July 11\nStock market today: Following weakness in the global markets, after the US Fed Jerome Powell did not offer any timeframe for the US Fed rate cut in 2024, the Indian stock market witnessed its worst session since 4th June 2024. The Nifty 50 index lost 108 points and closed at the 24,324 mark; the BSE Sensex finished 426 points down at 79,924, whereas the Bank Nifty index ended 379 points lower at 52,189. Cash market volumes on the NSE were 9% higher at \u20b91.48 lakh crore. The small-cap index fell more than the Nifty and Sensex even as the advance-decline ratio fell to 0.42:1.\n\nTrade setup for Thursday On the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The market's near-term uptrend status remains intact. However, the market seems to have started signs of profit booking around 24,400 to 24,500. A move above 24,465 could negate this bearish setup. The immediate support for Nifty today is placed at 24,150.\"\n\nOn the outlook for Bank Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"The Bank Nifty opened on a negative note and remained under pressure throughout the day. Finally, Bank Nifty settled the day negatively at 52,189 levels. Technically, on a daily scale, the Bank Nifty is currently placed near the lower end of the short-term consolidation zone (52,000-53,360). A relief rally is probable if Bank Nifty maintains its 52,000 support level. Conversely, sustenance below 52,000 levels could trigger further weakness in Bank Nifty.\"\n\nIT stocks in focus Speaking on the outlook for the Indian stock market today, Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal, said, \"We expect the market to consolidate in the higher zone, and any dip is a buying opportunity for long-term investors. Corporate earnings will start today, with TCS first announcing the numbers. Thus, the IT sector is expected to remain in focus.\"\n\nQ1 results today 15 Indian companies listed on the exchanges will declare their quarterly earnings for the April to June 2024 quarter. These companies include Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Anand Rathi, NELCO, GTPL Hathway, and Akme Fintrade India.\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Regarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended buying these five buy-or-sell stocks: Marico, Sun Pharma, MFSL, ATGL, and BPCL.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Marico: Buy at \u20b9646, target \u20b9700, stop loss \u20b9620.\n\nCurrently trading at 646.10 levels, the stock has demonstrated a strong rebound from the robust support level of \u20b9620, which lies close to its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This recovery indicates a bullish sentiment. The stock is now trading above all key moving averages, signalling strength and potential for further gains.\n\n2] Sun Pharma: Buy at \u20b91598.55, target \u20b91700, stop loss \u20b91550.\n\nSun Pharma share is presently trading at \u20b91598.55, bounced from the initial support of \u20b91550. This bounceback signifies a potential stock price shift, making it an intriguing investment prospect.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 3] MFSL: Buy at \u20b91036, target \u20b91080, stop loss \u20b91010.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis. This technical pattern suggests a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around \u20b91080. The stock is currently maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b91010. Given the current market price of \u20b91080, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b91080.\n\n4] ATGL: Buy at \u20b9890, target \u20b9940, stop loss \u20b9875.\n\nWe have seen significant support in this stock at around \u20b9875. So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen a reversal price action formation at the \u20b9890 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of \u20b9940. So, traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b9875 for the target price of \u20b9940 in the near term.\n\n5] BPCL: Buy at \u20b9300, target \u20b9320, stop loss \u20b9292.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis. This technical pattern suggests that the stock's price could temporarily retrace, possibly to around \u20b9320. Currently, the stock is holding a crucial support level at \u20b9292.\n\nGiven this scenario, the stock could rebound towards the \u20b9320 level in the near future.

The target price for this trade is \u20b9320, reflecting the anticipated upward movement based on the identified technical signals.",

The Nifty 50 closed the day at 24,433.20, up by 113 points or 0.46%, while the Sensex concluded with a gain of 391 points or 0.49% at 80,351.64. Both indices finished at their highest closing levels to date.\n\nTrade setup for Wednesday On the outlook for Nifty today, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities, said, \u201cNifty remained strong throughout the day, holding the support level of 24,300. The sentiment is likely to remain positive as long as it stays above 24,300, where significant put writing has occurred. On the higher end, the 24,500-24,600 range might act as an immediate resistance zone. Overall, the sentiment may continue to favor the bulls in the near term unless the index falls below 24,300.\u201d\n\nOn the outlook for Bank Nifty today, Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities, said, \"The Bank Nifty index witnessed a consolidated move and is stuck in a range between 52700-52100. A decisive break on either side will lead to trending moves. The index remains in a buy-on-dip mode, and a break above 52700 will open up further upside towards 53000, where the highest open interest is built up on the call side. However, if the index fails to hold the support of 52100-52000, it can decline further towards the 51700-51500 mark.\"\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Regarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended buying these five buy-or-sell stocks: Tega, Welcorp, Indigo, ATGL, and Navinfluor.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Tega Industries: Buy at \u20b9 1845.15, target \u20b9 1940, stop loss \u20b9 1777 TEGA is currently trading at \u20b91845.15. After a period of small falls and sideways consolidation, the stock has lately broken the neckline levels of \u20b91800 and is rising quickly on the upside with substantial volume. There are expectations of further upward movement, potentially reaching \u20b91940 levels. On the downside, substantial support is evident near \u20b91777.\n\nFurthermore, TEGA is trading above key Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), including the 20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day EMAs. This suggests a strong bullish momentum, indicating the potential for continued upward price action. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 69.03, signalling an upward trajectory and confirming an increase in buying momentum.\n\nIn summary, considering the technical analysis and prevailing market conditions, TEGA appears to present a promising buying opportunity for those targeting a \u20b91940 price objective, contingent upon the implementation of prudent risk management measures.\n\nTo manage risk effectively, it is advisable to set a stop-loss (SL) at \u20b91777 to protect the investment in case of an unexpected market reversal.\n\n2] Welcorp: Buy at \u20b9 643.55, target \u20b9 675, stop loss \u20b9 620 WELCORP Industries has recently exhibited a robust breakout from the critical resistance zone of 600-630 on the daily chart, consolidating the move with higher highs and higher lows. This breakout is supported by a notable increase in trading volume, indicating strong bullish sentiment.\n\nKey technical indicators, particularly the Relative Strength Index (RSI), emphasize the stock's positive momentum. The RSI not only signals positive trends but also aligns with the stock trading above crucial moving averages, including the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). This convergence underscores the sustained strength in WELCORP Industries price action.\n\nIn summary, the decisive breakout, coupled with favourable volume and a positive alignment of key technical indicators, suggests a bullish outlook for WELCORP Industries. Traders and investors may find this analysis indicative of potential continued upward momentum in the stock.\n\nBased on the above analysis we recommend buying WELCORP Industries in cash at CMP of 643.55 for the target of 675 with a stop loss of 620.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 3] Indigo: Buy at \u20b9 4305, target \u20b9 4450, stop loss \u20b9 4230 In the recent short-term trend analysis of the stock, a notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged. This technical pattern suggests the possibility of a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around Rs. 4450. At present, the stock is maintaining a crucial support level at Rs. 4230. Given the current market price of Rs. 4305, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors might consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of Rs.4450.\n\n4] ATGL: Buy at \u20b9 993, target \u20b9 1030, stop loss \u20b9 970 On the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the Rs. 990 price level has been observed, signaling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss at Rs. 970 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is Rs. 1030 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.\n\n5] Navin Fluorine International Limited: Buy at \u20b9 3695, target \u20b9 3800, stop loss \u20b9 3600 On the daily chart, the stock has shown a short-term reversal pattern. Specifically, a bullish engulfing pattern has formed, which is a strong indicator of potential upward movement. This technical pattern is considered bullish in nature, suggesting that the stock may experience a rise in price. Given this setup, traders might consider buying this stock, setting a stop loss at Rs. 3600 to manage risk. The target price for this trade is Rs. 3800, providing an opportunity for gains as the stock continues to demonstrate bullish behavior.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to Q1 results 2024, five stocks to buy or sell on Monday\nStock market today: Despite strong global market sentiments on the US Fed rate cut buzz, the Indian stock market remained sideways on Friday last week. The Nifty 50 index finished marginally higher at 24,168, whereas the BSE Sensex went off 53 points and closed at 79,478. The Bank Nifty index crashed 443 points and ended at 52,290. However, the broad market outperformed the frontline indices on Dalal Street. The small-cap index ended 0.70 percent higher while the mid-cap index went up 0.75 percent in the previous session.\n\nTrade setup for Monday On the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \u201cPreviously, a similar type of formation on 24th June has resulted in a sustainable upside move for the subsequent week. This is a positive indication. The underlying trend of Nifty continues to be positive. There is a possibility of an upside breakout hurdle around 24,400 to 24,500 levels in the next few sessions. Immediate support for Nifty today is placed at 24,170 levels.\u201d\n\nOn the outlook for Bank Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C. Mehta, said, \"The Bank Nifty opened with a gap down and remained under pressure throughout the day, led by HDFC Bank. Finally, Bank Nifty settled the day negatively at 52,660 levels. From a technical standpoint, the index is consolidating in the band of 52,000-53,200. Either side's breakout will set the index's further direction.\"\n\nUnveiling the Indian stock market strategy for intraday trading, Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal, said, \u201cAfter a run-up of ~7% in the last month, we expect the market to consolidate at a higher zone. In this week, we expect stock and sector-specific action as the market starts taking cues from Q1FY25 earnings. On the macro front, investors will look for inflation data that India, the US, and China will release.\u201d\n\nQ1 results today Q1FY25 earnings season has begun, and three listed companies are going to declare their Q1 results 2024 today. Those three listed entities are Shalby, Khoobsurat, and SecUR Credentia.\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Regarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended buying these five buy-or-sell stocks: Zydus Wellness, Voltamp, Coromandel International, Exide Industries, and IRCTC.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Zydus Wellness: Buy at \u20b92118.25, target \u20b92222, stop loss \u20b92050.\n\nThe analysis suggests a positive outlook for ZYDUSWELL based on the daily chart. The stock has shown a consistent higher high and higher low pattern over the past five days, with a recent breakout above the neckline indicating a potential upward movement. The increase in trading volume and the stock trading above the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) for the short term of \u20b92105 further support a bullish scenario.\n\n2] Voltamp Transformers: Buy at \u20b913219.85, target \u20b913950, stop loss \u20b912780.\n\nVOLTAMP is exhibiting strong bullish momentum, currently trading at an all-time high of \u20b913468.90. The recent breakout above the crucial resistance at \u20b912500 levels is a significant technical development supported by robust trading volumes, reinforcing the strength of the stock. The breakthrough suggests a potential continuation of the upward trend, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 3] Coromandel International: Buy at \u20b91580 to \u20b91592, target \u20b91640, stop loss \u20b91555.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis. This technical pattern suggests a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around \u20b91640. The stock is currently maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b91555. Given the current market price of \u20b91592, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b91640.\n\n4] Exide Industries: Buy at \u20b9568, target \u20b9588, stop loss \u20b9545.\n\nWe have seen significant support in this stock, around \u20b9545. So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen a reversal price action formation at the \u20b9568 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of \u20b9588. So, traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b9545 for the target price of \u20b9588 in the near term.\n\n5] IRCTC: Buy at \u20b91020 to \u20b91030, target \u20b91070, stop loss \u20b9970.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis. This technical pattern suggests that the stock's price could temporarily retrace, possibly to around \u20b91070. Currently, the stock is holding a crucial support level at \u20b9970.\n\nGiven this scenario, the stock could rebound towards the \u20b91070 level in the near future. Traders are advised to consider taking a long position, with a strategic stop loss set at \u20b9970, to manage risk effectively. The target price for this trade is \u20b91070, reflecting the anticipated upward movement based on the identified technical signals.",

The Nifty 50 index closed marginally higher at 24,302, whereas the BSE Sensex ended 62 points up at the 80,049 mark. The Bank Nifty index edged 14 points higher and closed at 53,103. Cash market volumes on the NSE rose around 2 percent to \u20b91.38 lakh crore. The broad market indices rose more than the Nifty 50 index even as the advance-decline ratio fell to 1.19:1.\n\nTrade setup for Friday On the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The overall trend of Nifty remains positive as per smaller to larger timeframe chart. Though Nifty placed at the highs, there is still no confirmation of any reversal pattern forming at the new all-time highs. However, having placed at the hurdle of around 24400 levels (1.618% Fibonacci Extension), this consolidation/minor dip is possible for the coming sessions. Immediate support is at 23,990 \u201410day EMA.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Om Mehra, Technical Analyst at SAMCO Securities, said, \u201cBank Nifty marked a new high of 53,357.70 and settled at 53,103.70, ending the day almost flat. The index found support from the rising trendline, highlighting the positive trend. With the opening and day's high remaining identical, a short-term pullback is possible if Bank Nifty slips below 52,800, potentially heading towards 52,200. The daily RSI is displaying strength and stands at the 67 level.\u201d\n\nOn the outlook for the Indian stock market today, Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal, said, \u201cThe Release of pre-quarterly business updates is giving confidence in healthy Q1 earnings. Sentiments got a further boost in the hope of a rate cut as the recent data points indicate the softening of the US economy. We expect this ongoing momentum to continue and Nifty to consolidate in a broader range. Investors would watch for the US non-farm payroll and unemployment rate, which will be released today.\u201d\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Regarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended buying these five buy-or-sell stocks: Bharat Dynamics Limited, Aurobindo Pharma Limited, Exide Industries, Bank of Baroda, and HCL Technologies.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Bharat Dynamics: Buy at \u20b91684, target \u20b91770, stop loss \u20b91625.\n\nBharat Dynamics share price is currently trading at \u20b91683.9. After minor falls and sideways consolidation, the stock has lately broken the neckline levels of \u20b91650 and is rising quickly on the upside with substantial volume. There are expectations of upward movement, potentially reaching the \u20b91770 mark. On the downside, considerable support is evident near \u20b91625.\n\n2] Aurobindo Pharma: Buy at \u20b91254.65, target \u20b91355, stop loss \u20b91200.\n\nAurobindo Pharma's share price exhibits resilience, having rebounded from the support range and passed a small resistance of \u20b91225 levels, which is also close to its 20-day EMA levels, indicating underlying strength in the stock. Currently trading at \u20b91254.65 levels, it maintains positions above crucial moving averages, including the short-term (20-day), medium-term (50-day), and long-term (200-day) EMAs, signalling a bullish sentiment.\n\nGanesh Dongres's buy or sell stocks 3] Exide Industries: Buy at \u20b9566, target \u20b9585, stop loss \u20b9545.\n\nOn the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the \u20b9566 price level has been observed, signalling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss of \u20b9545 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b9585 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.\n\n4] Bank of Baroda: Buy at \u20b9270, target \u20b9282, stop loss \u20b9264.\n\nOn the daily chart, the stock has shown a short-term reversal pattern. Specifically, a bullish engulfing pattern has formed, a strong indicator of potential upward movement. This technical pattern is considered bullish, suggesting that the stock may experience a price rise. Given this setup, traders might consider buying this stock, setting a stop loss at \u20b9264 to manage risk. The target price for this trade is \u20b9282, providing an opportunity for gains as the stock continues to demonstrate bullish behaviour.\n\n5] HCL Technologies: Buy at \u20b91520, target \u20b91570, stop loss \u20b91470.\n\nIn the short term, the stock has seen a bullish reversal pattern. Technically, retrenchment could be possible until \u20b91570. So, holding the support level of \u20b91470, this stock can bounce toward \u20b91570 in the short term.

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to US Fed meeting, experts recommend five stocks to buy or sell on Thursday\nStock market today: Following strong global market sentiments on the US Fed rate cut buzz, the Indian stock market ended higher on Wednesday. Strong buying was witnessed across segments; all three frontline indices touched a new lifetime high. The Nifty 50 index ended at 24,286 after a new high of 24,309. The BSE Sensex finished at 79,986 after climbing to a new peak of 80,074. The Bank Nifty index ended at 53,089 after hitting a new lifetime high of 53,256. Cash market volumes on the NSE rose 2.4% to \u20b91.36 lakh crores. The broad market indices rose more than the Nifty even as the advance-decline ratio rose to 1.7:1.\n\nTrade setup for Thursday On the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The overall trend of Nifty remains positive. Further consolidation or minor dips from here could be a buying opportunity per the bullish pattern of higher tops and bottoms. Nifty, as per the long-term chart, remains strong, and one may expect upside momentum to resume shortly after the consolidation movement. Immediate support is at 23980. The next upside resistance is around 24400.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"Nifty Bank also reached a RECord high of 53,256.70 in the morning trade, driven by HDFC Bank, and then witnessed some profit booking on higher levels. Finally, Nifty Bank settled the day at a record high of 53,089 levels. From a technical standpoint, the index is consolidating in the band of 52,000-53,200. If the index sustains above 53,200, then the rally could extend towards 54,000-54,200 levels.\"\n\nPointing towards the reason for the uptrend on Dalal Street, Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal, said, \u201cMarkets cheered the dovish commentary from US Fed Chair Powell. This, along with healthy domestic macros and hope of a growth-focused budget, led to a positive up-move in the market. We expect this ongoing momentum to continue in the near term.\u201d\n\nUS Fed meeting minutes The members of the US Federal Reserve's rate-setting committee said last month that the bank's employment and inflation goals were moving into \"better balance,\" with some calling for \"patience\" on interest rate cuts, according to minutes of the meeting published Wednesday.\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Regarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended buying these five buy-or-sell stocks: Cochin Shipyard, Cholamandalam Investment and Finance, BHEL, REC, and RBL Bank.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Cochin Shipyard: Buy at \u20b92436.35, target \u20b92555, stop loss \u20b92345.\n\nCochin Shipyard share is currently trading at \u20b92436.35. After minor falls and sideways consolidation, the stock has lately broken the neckline levels of \u20b92333 and is rising quickly on the upside with substantial volume... There are expectations of further upward movement, potentially reaching \u20b92555 levels. On the downside, considerable support is evident near \u20b92345.\n\n2] Cholamandalam Investment and Finance: Buy at \u20b91435.30, target \u20b91530, stop loss \u20b91385.\n\nCholamandalam Investment and Finance share is trading at \u20b91435.30, demonstrating technical strength. The stock has robust support at \u20b91385 levels, slightly below its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This support level fortifies the stock's resilience. CHOLAFIN is also trading above its short-term (20-day), medium-term (50-day), and long-term (200-day) EMA levels, indicating a bullish trend and underlying strength.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 3] BHEL: Buy at \u20b9312, target \u20b9321, stop loss \u20b9305.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis. This technical pattern suggests a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around \u20b9321. The stock is currently maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b9305. Given the current market price of \u20b9312, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b9321.\n\n4] REC: Buy at \u20b9561, target \u20b9582, stop loss \u20b9550.\n\nOn the daily chart of this stock, a breakout at the \u20b9561 price level has been observed, signalling a potential upward trend. Complementing this breakout, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still turning up, indicating increasing buying momentum. Given these technical indicators, traders can consider buying on dips, entering the stock at a lower price point. To manage risk, a stop loss of \u20b9550 is recommended. The target price for this strategy is \u20b9582 in the upcoming weeks, suggesting a potential gain as the stock continues its upward trajectory.\n\n5] RBL Bank: Buy at \u20b9268, target \u20b9282, stop loss \u20b9260.\n\nOn the daily chart, the stock has shown a short-term reversal pattern. Specifically, a bullish engulfing pattern has formed, a strong indicator of potential upward movement. This technical pattern is considered bullish, suggesting that the stock may experience a price rise. Given this setup, traders might consider buying this stock, setting a stop loss at \u20b9260 to manage risk. The target price for this trade is \u20b9282, providing an opportunity for gains as the stock continues to demonstrate bullish behaviour.",

The Nifty 50 reached a new all-time peak of 24,236.35 during the session but concluded slightly lower, down 18 points or 0.07 per cent, at 24,123.85. Similarly, the Sensex, comprising 30 shares, achieved a fresh record high of 79,855.87 before settling with a minor decline of 35 points or 0.04 per cent, closing at 79,441.45.\n\n\u201cThe domestic market took a breather, resonating with the mixed global trend, with the ECB showing caution regarding further rate cuts. In sectoral trends, IT stocks gained due to expected increases in discretionary spending, while auto stocks declined following lower-than-expected monthly volumes. The investors are closely monitoring the progress of the monsoon, the forthcoming union budget, alongside the US election, which can have potential global economic implications. Recent spikes in US Treasury yields and a gradual rise in crude oil prices are affecting market trends,\u201d said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.\n\nAlso Read | Zerodha may end zero brokerage model for equity delivery trades: Nithin Kamath\n\nTrade setup for Wednesday On the outlook for Nifty today, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities, said, \"The Nifty faced profit booking around 24,200, leading to a close 100 points off the high. The sentiment is likely to favour selling on rallies until it moves above 24,250. On the lower end, 24,000 is likely to act as immediate support for the Nifty. A fall below 24,000 might trigger a correction towards 23,850/23,700.\"\n\nOn today's outlook for the Bank Nifty, Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities, said, \"The Bank Nifty index witnessed selling pressure from higher levels and faced rejection at the 52,400-52,500 levels. The index remains in a sell-on-rise mode with the next immediate support at the 52,000-51,800 zone. If the index fails to hold this support, it can witness further selling pressure towards the 51,400-51,300 level.\"\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Regarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended these five buy-or-sell stocks: SBI Life, Indigo, DMart, Bombay Dyeing and Craftsman.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] SBI Life Insurance: Buy at \u20b9 1,495, target \u20b9 1,550, stop loss \u20b9 1,460 In the recent short-term trend analysis of the stock, a notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged. This technical pattern suggests the possibility of a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around \u20b91,550. At present, the stock is maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b91,460. Given the current market price of around \u20b91,495, a buying opportunity is emerging. This suggests that investors might consider purchasing the stock at its current price, anticipating a rise towards the identified target of \u20b91,550.\n\n2] Indigo: Buy at \u20b9 4,249, target \u20b9 4,380, stop loss \u20b9 4,180 We have seen a major support in this stock around \u20b94,180 So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen a reversal price action formation at the \u20b94,249 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of \u20b94,380 so traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b94,180 for the target price of \u20b94,380 in the upcoming weeks.\n\n3] DMart: Buy at \u20b9 4,770, target \u20b9 4,950, stop loss \u20b9 4,650 In the recent short-term trend analysis of the stock, a notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged. This technical pattern suggests that there could be a temporary retracement in the stock's price, possibly to around \u20b94,950 Currently, the stock is holding a crucial support level at \u20b94,650.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 4] Bombay Dyeing: Buy at \u20b9 216.50, target \u20b9 228, stop loss \u20b9 209 Bombay Dyeing is exhibiting strong bullish momentum, currently recording an all-time high of \u20b9219.3 levels. The recent breakout above the crucial resistance at 207 levels is a significant technical development, supported by robust trading volumes, reinforcing the strength in the stock. The breakthrough suggests a potential continuation of the upward trend, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.\n\nAdditionally, Bombay Dyeing stock is trading above key moving averages, including the short-term (20 Day), medium-term (50 Day), and long-term (200 Day) EMAs, further affirming its bullish stance.

This technical pattern suggests a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around \u20b9210. The stock is currently maintaining a crucial support level at \u20b9192.

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to Budget 2024, five stocks to buy or sell on Monday \u2014 July 1\nStock market today: After showing positive movement in the first four sessions last week, the Indian stock market slipped into the profit-booking zone on Friday. The Nifty 50 index went off 33 points and closed at 24,010, whereas the BSE Sensex shed 210 points and finished at 79,032. The Bank Nifty index ended 469 points lower at 52,342. However, the broad market outperformed the frontline indices and finished positively. The small-cap index ended 0.56 percent higher while the mid-cap index finished 0.41 percent higher on the previous session.\n\nTrade setup for Monday On the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The near-term uptrend status of Nifty remains intact. Having moved up sharply, Nifty is currently facing hurdles at the resistance of 24000-24100 levels. Any dip from here is likely to be a buying opportunity. Immediate support is at 23,800 levels.\"\n\nOn the outlook for Bank Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"Bank Nifty opened with a gap-up but failed to sustain higher levels, resulting in profit booking. Finally, the index settled the day on a negative note at 52,342. From a technical standpoint, the index has formed a bearish candle near trend line resistance. Thus, for the short term, 53,200 will act as a hurdle for Bank Nifty. If the index sustains above the 53,200 levels, then the rally could extend towards 54,000.\"\n\nOn triggers that may dictate the Indian stock market today, Siddhartha Khemka, Senior Group VP & Head of Research \u2014 Broking & Distribution at Motilal Oswal, said, \"Nifty and Sensex have crossed historic milestones with both the indices making fresh highs of 24174 and 79671 levels respectively. We expect this positive momentum to continue steadily with stock-specific action. However, the release of economic data points next week would keep the market volatile a little. The sector like Auto is expected to be in the limelight as OEMs would release their monthly auto Sales number.\"\n\nBudget 2024 in focus Advising investors to remain vigilant about the developments regarding the Union Budget 2024, Mahavir Lunawat, Managing Director at Pantomath Capital Advisors, said, \u201cIn pre-budget consultations, economists urged Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to prioritize capital spending for economic expansion, maintain fiscal discipline, and mitigate inflation risks associated with indiscriminate subsidies. Industry bodies like CII and PHDCCI advocated for tax incentives, increased capital expenditure, and targeted reforms such as expanding PLI schemes and addressing food inflation through initiatives like FIRST. The agriculture and MSME sectors stressed the need for subsidy rationalization, bolstered infrastructure investment, and supportive policies for exports and startups. The budget is expected to focus on these priorities, likely introducing measures such as subsidy reforms, infrastructure enhancements, MSME incentives, and tax adjustments aimed at fostering economic growth, job creation, and bolstering India's economic resilience on the global stage.\u201d\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Regarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommend buying these five buy-on-sell stocks: Garware Hi-Tech, Grasim Industries, IGL, Canara Bank, and RCF.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Garware Hi-Tech: Buy at \u20b92356.40, target \u20b92470, stop loss \u20b92270.\n\nGarware Hi-Tech is currently trading at \u20b92356.4. After a period of small falls and sideways consolidation, the stock has lately broken the neckline levels of \u20b92200 and is rising quickly on the upside with substantial volume. There are expectations of further upward movement, potentially reaching \u20b92470 levels. On the downside, considerable support is evident near \u20b92270.\n\n2] Grasim Industries: Buy at \u20b92670.45, target \u20b92800, stop loss \u20b92575.\n\nGrasim Industries daily chart analysis offers a favourable view for the following week, indicating a steady higher advance. Notably, the stock has produced a notable higher high and higher low pattern, and the company's recent upward swing has effectively violated the neckline, establishing a new week high. This breakthrough indicates the possibility of a significant follow-through upward increase in the stock price.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 3] IGL: Buy at \u20b9504, target \u20b9525, stop loss \u20b9485.\n\nWe have seen significant support in this stock, around \u20b9485. So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen a reversal price action formation at the \u20b9504 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of \u20b9525. So, traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b9485 for the target price of \u20b9525 in the near term.\n\n4] Canara Bank: Buy at \u20b9119, target \u20b9126, stop loss \u20b9115.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis. This technical pattern suggests that there could be a temporary retracement in the stock's price, possibly to around \u20b9126.

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to US inflation, five stocks to buy or sell on Friday \u2014 June 28\nStock market today: Despite weakness in the global markets, the Indian stock market continues to scale northward on Thursday. The Nifty 50 index ended 175 points higher at the 20,044 mark after climbing to a new peak of 24,087. The BSE Sensex finished 568 points higher at 79,243 after hitting a new record high of 79,396. However, the Nifty Bank index lost its early morning gains and ended 59 points lower at 52,811 after touching a new lifetime high of 53,180. The broad markets underperformed the Nifty even as the advance-decline ratio fell sharply to 0.48:1.\n\nTrade setup for Friday On the Nifty 50 index outlook, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The underlying trend of Nifty continues to be positive. A sustainable move above 24000-24100 levels could soon pull Nifty towards another Fibonacci extension resistance of around 24380-24400. Immediate support for Nifty today is placed at 23800 levels.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Om Mehra, Technical Analyst at SAMCO Securities, said, \"Bank Nifty reached a new all-time high over three consecutive days, peaking at 53,180.75 before settling lower on Thursday at 52,811.30, a marginal decline of 0.11%. The resistance at the 2.618 Fibonacci level near 53,300 suggests a potential barrier. Following a bearish candle on the daily chart, Bank Nifty may consolidate within a range with subdued momentum. The support is currently positioned at the 52,200-52,000 levels. A breakthrough above 53,080 could signal a continuation of the uptrend towards 53,450-53,500 levels.\"\n\nSpeaking on the outlook for the Indian stock market today, Vikram Kasat, Head of Advisory at Prabhudas Lilladher, said, \"The importance of an undercurrent is only felt when the tide turns. Index-heavy constituents are doing well, but the broader market is starting to bleed. Staying extremely stock-specific and nimble is the current requirement as a trader. For today, it looks like IT stocks will lead the pack. The Bajaj twins also look promising. The IT Index is breaking out today ahead of earnings season.\"\n\nUS inflation data in focus \"The global markets, including Dalal Street investors, would await the US inflation data release, which is expected today. The US inflation data is important for global assets as it would hint about the possible US Fed rate cut in the near term,\" said Avinash Gorakshkar, Head of Research at Profitmart Securities.\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Regarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommend buying these five buy-or-sell stocks: Asahi Songwon, Bayer Crop, Tata Motors, DMart, and Apollo Hospitals.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Asahi Songwon: Buy at \u20b9446.90, target \u20b94465, stop loss \u20b9430.\n\nAsahi Songwon shares have recently experienced a significant breakthrough above the crucial resistance zone, ranging from \u20b9410 to \u20b9435 on the daily chart. This breakout has been accompanied by a consolidation of the upward movement, characterized by higher highs and higher lows. A noticeable surge in trading volume further validates the strong bullish sentiment.\n\n2] Bayer Crop: Buy at \u20b9@ 6653.90, target \u20b97000, stop loss \u20b96430.\n\nBayer Crop share price is exhibiting strong bullish momentum, currently trading at an all-time high of \u20b96825 levels. The recent breakout above the crucial resistance at \u20b96600 levels is a significant technical development supported by robust trading volumes, reinforcing the strength of the stock. The breakthrough suggests a potential continuation of the upward trend, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 3] Tata Motors: Buy at \u20b9972, target \u20b9995, stop loss \u20b9945.\n\nWe have seen significant support in this stock, around \u20b9945. So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen a reversal price action formation at the \u20b9972 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of \u20b9995. So, traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b9945 for the target price of \u20b9995 in the near term.\n\n4] DMart: Buy at \u20b94930, target \u20b95100, stop loss \u20b94750.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis. This technical pattern suggests that there could be a temporary retracement in the stock's price, possibly to around \u20b95100. Currently, the stock is holding a crucial support level at \u20b94750.\n\nGiven this scenario, the stock could rebound towards the \u20b95100 level in the near future. Traders are advised to consider taking a long position, with a strategic stop loss set at \u20b94750, to manage risk effectively. The target price for this trade is \u20b95100, reflecting the anticipated upward movement based on the identified technical signals.\n\n5] Apollo Hospitals: Buy at \u20b96190, target \u20b96350, stop loss \u20b96060.\n\nThe stock has consistently found strong support, around \u20b96060, which is encouraging for its current trajectory.

In the broad market, the small-cap index scaled 0.15 percent higher, while the mid-cap index ended 0.29 percent lower.\n\nTrade setup for Thursday Speaking on the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"After moving into a range bound action in the mid part of June month, Nifty is now witnessing a decisive upside breakout of the said range movement. The present upside momentum could find resistance at the highs of around 24000-24100 levels (1.786% Fibonacci extension of crucial bottom/top/bottom of 2020-2022). One may expect the next round of consolidation or minor weakness to emerge from the highs.

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to global markets, five stocks to buy or sell on Monday \u2014 June 24\nBuy or sell stocks for today: Following weak global cues, the Indian stock market ended lower on Friday last week. Among the frontline indices, the Nifty 50 index dropped 65 points and closed at 23,501, while the BSE Sensex lost 269 points and closed at 77,209. The Nifty Bank index finished 121 points lower at 51,661. Cash market volumes on the NSE rose to \u20b91.87 lakh crore, aided by index rebalancing flows. The small-cap index ended marginally in the green even as the advance-decline ratio fell to 0.81:1.\n\nTrade setup for Monday Speaking on the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"Though Nifty placed at the highs, there is still no confirmation of any significant reversal pattern building at the highs. Further weakness only below 23300 levels could be considered a short-term top reversal pattern. Further sustainable upside bounce is likely to negate this negative setup.\"\n\nOn the outlook for Bank Nifty today, Om Mehra, Technical Analyst at SAMCO Securities, said, \"After a brief period of consolidation, Bank Nifty broke out to reach an all-time high of 51,957, closing at 51,398.05 with a 1.90% gain. This movement formed a strong daily bullish candle. Importantly, Bank Nifty surpassed its previous high of June 3, indicating a possible push towards the 127.8% Fibonacci extension level at 52,550. The RSI now stands at 64, reflecting a sustained momentum.\"\n\nGlobal market news Asian shares were mostly lower Friday after a retreat on Wall Street, where a drop in Nvidia stock pulled stocks lower. European shares, however, rose. Eurozone business recovery slowed sharply in June as the manufacturing sector downturn gathered momentum and activity in the services sector deteriorated. The HCOB's preliminary composite Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by S&P Global, fell to 50.8 from May's 52.2.\n\nIn the US stock market, the Dow Jones index added 0.04 percent on Friday, whereas the S&P 500 and Nasdaq lost 0.16 percent. However, the small-cap 2000 index finished 0.23 percent higher.\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Regarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended five buy or sell stocks.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Zensar Technologies: Buy at \u20b9752, target \u20b9790, stop loss \u20b9725.\n\nZensar Technologies' daily chart analysis offers a favourable view for the following week, indicating a steady higher advance. Notably, the stock has produced a notable higher high and higher low pattern in the weekly frame, and the company's recent upward swing has effectively violated the neckline, establishing a new week high. This breakthrough indicates the possibility of a significant follow-through upward increase in the stock price.\n\n2] Whirlpool: Buy at \u20b91847, target \u20b91950, stop loss \u20b91785.\n\nWhirlpool is currently trading at \u20b91847.20. The stock has consistently found support around the \u20b91785 level, establishing it as a reliable support zone. The anticipated trading range for the stock is expected to be between \u20b91800 and \u20b91888, with the possibility of sideways movement within this range. A decisive close above the \u20b91890 level could propel the stock towards the \u20b91950 level in the coming days.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 3] IndiGo: Buy at \u20b94300, target \u20b94450, stop loss \u20b94210.\n\nAt \u20b94210, the stock found a substantial support level, marking a crucial juncture in its recent trading. At \u20b94300, the stock has demonstrated a definitive price-action reversal, suggesting a potential continuation of its upward momentum. Traders keen on seizing this opportunity could consider buying and holding the stock, setting a prudent stop loss at \u20b94210. The anticipated target for this trade is \u20b94450, representing the next significant resistance level. This strategy positions traders favourably to capitalize on the stock's expected rally in the weeks ahead.\n\n4] Indus Tower: Buy at \u20b9336, target \u20b9355, stop loss \u20b9326.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis. This technical pattern suggests that there could be a temporary retracement in the stock's price, possibly to around \u20b9355. Currently, the stock is holding a crucial support level at \u20b9326.\n\nGiven this scenario, the stock could rebound towards the \u20b9355 level in the near future. Traders are advised to consider taking a long position, with a strategic stop loss set at \u20b9326, to manage risk effectively. The target price for this trade is \u20b9355, reflecting the anticipated upward movement based on the identified technical signals.\n\n5] PVR INOX: Buy at \u20b91437, target \u20b91490, stop loss \u20b91400.\n\nThe stock has consistently found strong support, around \u20b91400, which is encouraging for its current trajectory. Recently, it has shown a promising reversal pattern near the \u20b91437 mark, suggesting potential for further upward movement. The stock could continue its rally towards the next resistance level at \u20b91490. Traders might consider buying and holding this stock, using a prudent stop loss at \u20b91400 to mitigate risks. The target price for this trade is \u20b91490, with expectations set for developments over the near term.",

Among the Nifty 50 firms, 28 rose while 21 fell, indicating a largely favourable market outlook.\n\nThe mid- and small-cap indices beat large-cap equities, pointing to a bigger market rebound.\n\nLeading the drive were firms like as Hindalco, Grasim Industries, JSW Steel, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and Adani Ports.\n\nAccording to Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, despite enormous volatility, the domestic market closed the day on a positive note. In the immediate term, market attention is expected to be concentrated on the upcoming Union budget and monsoon season. On a global scale, the decline in US bond rates has enabled considerable FII inflows in recent days. Fertilizer stocks increased considerably, driven by the projected GST reduction and MSP increases.\n\nTrade setup for Friday According to Prashanth Tapse, Research Analyst, Senior Vice President of Research at Mehta Equities, the trading theme revolves around markets increasing bets into the narrative that a soft landing in the US is underway.\n\nNifty 50's immediate goal post seen at its psychological 23,750 mark and then aggressive targets placed at 24,000 mark.\n\nThe line in the sand is at Nifty 50's make-or-break support at 23,350 mark. Nifty 50's 200 DMA is placed at 21,310 mark.\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Stock experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, have recommended five stocks to buy or sell today.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today Buy Stove Kraft Ltd in cash at \u20b9 574.3; Stop Loss at \u20b9 550; Target Price at \u20b9 610 Stove Kraft Ltd daily chart analysis reveals a notable shift in market dynamics, transitioning from a period of minor declines and sideways consolidation to a promising upside bounce. The current trading session reflects an up move, potentially signalling an upside breakout from narrow range momentum. This development aligns with a positive short-term trend, further reinforced by a surge in trading volume.\n\nKey technical indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 71.85, underscore the stock's positive momentum. The RSI not only exhibits positive signals, but the stock is also trading above crucial moving averages\u2014specifically, the 20-day, 50-day, and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). This convergence suggests sustained strength in Stove Kraft price action.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we recommend buying Stove Kraft in cash at a CMP of \u20b9574.3 for the target of \u20b9610 with a stop loss of \u20b9550.\n\nBuy Thirumalai Chemicals Ltd in cash at \u20b9 326.8; Stop Loss at \u20b9 315; Target Price at \u20b9 345 Thirumalai Chemicals Ltd daily chart analysis offers a favourable view for the following week, indicating a steady, higher advance. Notably, the stock has produced a notable higher high and higher low pattern, and the company's recent upward swing has effectively violated the neckline, establishing a new week high. This breakthrough indicates the possibility of a significant follow-through upward increase in the stock price.\n\nAdding to the positive momentum, there has been an increase in trading volume, indicating growing market interest.

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50, five stocks to buy or sell on Thursday - June 20\nStock market today: On Wednesday's trading session, the domestic benchmark indices, Nifty 50 and Sensex, reached fresh record highs of 23,664 and 77,851.63, respectively, but the Nifty 50 failed to maintain its gains, closing in the red as profit-booking set in at higher levels.\n\nBroader markets also lagged benchmarks, with the Nifty Midcap 50 down 0.95% and the Nifty Smallcap Index down 0.46%.\n\nHowever, according to market analysts, the significant positive takeaway was that short covering and value buying propelled Bank Nifty, which completely outperformed the benchmark Nifty 50 and, more crucially, scaled a new all-time high of 5,1957.\n\nAccording to Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, the domestic market has begun on a positive note, owing to an earlier and more accurate monsoon projection. However, due to the current slow pace of the monsoon, the market is taking a break. Meanwhile, the banking sector is outperforming, despite being a laggard year-to-date, thanks to a rebound in FII inflows as the US 10-year yield continues to fall.\n\nTrade setup for Thursday According to Prashanth Tapse, Research Analyst, Senior Vice President of Research at Mehta Equities, Despite Wednesday's profit-booking, the trading theme revolves around markets increasing bets into the narrative that a soft landing in the US is underway.\n\nNifty 50's immediate goal post seen at its psychological 23,750 mark and then aggressive targets placed at 24,000 mark. The line in the sand is at Nifty 50's make-or-break support at 23,350 mark. Nifty 50's 200 DMA is placed at 21,287 mark, explained Tapse.\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Stock market gurus Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, advised five buy-or-sell stocks for today.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today Buy State Bank of India (SBI) in cash at \u20b9 852.60; Stop Loss at \u20b9 828; Target Price at \u20b9 905 State Bank of India is currently positioned at a crucial juncture in its trading dynamics. With a robust support base at 828 levels, near its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), the stock stands resilient. Trading at approximately 852.60 levels, SBIN exhibits strength by maintaining levels above key moving averages.\n\nThe charts unveil a minor resistance barrier at 860 levels, a threshold the stock needs to surpass to pave the way for an upward trajectory. A successful breach of this resistance can potentially propel SBI towards its target price of 905 and beyond. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at a comfortable 57.18 further bolsters the case for strength in the stock.\n\nInvestors and traders alike should closely monitor SBI's performance around the noted levels, as a breakout from the resistance can signify a bullish phase, offering potential opportunities for those eyeing upward movements in the stock.\n\nBased on the above technical analysis we recommend buying SBI at CMP of \u20b9852.60 with a Stop Loss of \u20b9828 for the target price of \u20b9905.\n\nBuy Infosys in cash at \u20b9 1,511.35; Stop Loss at \u20b9 1,475; Target Price at \u20b9 1,590 Infosys, currently trading at \u20b91,511.35, has recently broken out above \u20b91,505 and formed a bullish candle on the daily chart. The immediate support is near the \u20b91,475 level which is also close to its short term (20 Day) and medium term (50 Day0 EMA levels, and the current price is exhibiting strong bullish momentum, expected to continue towards the \u20b91,590 level.\n\nMoreover, Infosys is trading above key Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), including the 20-day and 50-day EMAs, indicating robust bullish momentum and suggesting potential for further upward price movement. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is presently at 60.22, showing an upward trajectory and indicating increasing buying momentum. These technical indicators collectively suggest that Infosys may have the potential to reach a target price of \u20b91,590 in the near term.\n\nTo manage risk effectively, it is advisable to set a stop-loss at \u20b91,475 to safeguard the investment in the event of an unexpected market turn. A prudent strategy would be to consider buying on dips at levels of \u20b91,505.\n\nOverall, considering the technical analysis and current market conditions, Infosys presents a promising buying opportunity for those aiming for a \u20b91,590 price target, provided that prudent risk management measures are in place.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today Buy Kotak Mahindra Bank at \u20b9 1,744; Stoploss at \u20b9 1,720; Target Price at 1,790 At \u20b91,720, the stock found a substantial support level, marking a crucial juncture in its recent trading. Presently, at \u20b91,744, the stock has demonstrated a definitive reversal in price action, suggesting a potential continuation of its upward momentum. Traders keen on seizing this opportunity could consider buying and holding the stock, setting a prudent stop loss at \u20b91,720. The anticipated target for this trade is \u20b91,790, representing the next significant resistance level. This strategy positions traders favourably to capitalise on the stock's anticipated rally in the weeks ahead.\n\nBuy Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd at \u20b9 1,450; Stoploss at \u20b9 1,420, and Target Price at \u20b9 1,490 In the recent short-term trend analysis of the stock, a notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged. This technical pattern suggests that there could be a temporary retracement in the stock's price, possibly to around \u20b91,490. Currently, the stock is holding a crucial support level at \u20b91,420.\n\nGiven this scenario, there is potential for the stock to rebound towards the \u20b91,490 level in the near future. Traders are advised to consider taking a long position, with a strategic stop loss set at \u20b91,420 to manage risk effectively. The target price for this trade is \u20b91,490, reflecting the anticipated upward movement based on the identified technical signals.\n\nBuy Carborundum Universal Ltd at \u20b9 1,825; Stoploss at \u20b9 1,800; Target Price at \u20b9 1,855 The stock has consistently found strong support around \u20b91,800, which is encouraging for its current trajectory. Recently, it has shown a promising reversal pattern near the \u20b91,825 mark, suggesting potential for further upward movement. There's a possibility that the stock could continue its rally towards the next resistance level at \u20b91,855. Traders might consider buying and holding this stock, using a prudent stop loss at \u20b91,800 to mitigate risks. The target price for this trade is \u20b91,855, with expectations set for developments over the upcoming weeks.",

If the price manages to close above the \u20b9742 level, it may have the potential to reach short-term targets of \u20b9804. On the other hand, immediate support levels are located at \u20b9720. These levels can be considered opportunities to buy on dips.\n\n2] UTI AMC: Buy at \u20b91044, target \u20b91100, stop loss \u20b91005.\n\nUTIAMC daily chart analysis offers a favourable view for the following week, indicating a steady higher advance.

At \u20b91126, the stock has demonstrated a definitive price-action reversal, suggesting a potential continuation of its upward momentum. Traders keen on seizing this opportunity could consider buying and holding the stock, setting a prudent stop loss at \u20b91105. The anticipated target for this trade is \u20b91160, representing the next significant resistance level. This strategy positions traders favourably to capitalize on the stock's expected rally soon.\n\n4] Radico Khaitan: Buy at \u20b91780, target \u20b91830, stop loss \u20b91755.\n\nA notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged in the stock's recent short-term trend analysis. This technical pattern suggests that there could be a temporary retracement in the stock's price, possibly to around \u20b91830. Currently, the stock is holding a crucial support level at \u20b91755.\n\nGiven this scenario, the stock could rebound towards the \u20b91830 level in the near future. Traders are advised to consider taking a long position, with a strategic stop loss set at \u20b91755, to manage risk effectively. The target price for this trade is \u20b91830, reflecting the anticipated upward movement based on the identified technical signals.\n\n5] Ramkrishna Forgings: Buy at \u20b9809, target \u20b9840, stop loss \u20b9785.\n\nThe stock has consistently found strong support, around \u20b9755, which is encouraging for its current trajectory. Recently, it has shown a promising reversal pattern near the \u20b9809 mark, suggesting potential for further upward movement. The stock could continue its rally towards the next resistance level at \u20b9840. Traders might consider buying and holding this stock, using a prudent stop loss at \u20b9785 to mitigate risks. The target price for this trade is \u20b9840, with expectations set for developments over the near term.\n\nShiju Koothupalakkal's buy or sell stocks 6] EIH: Buy at \u20b9449, target \u20b9468, stop loss \u20b9440.\n\nThe stock has indicated a higher low formation on the daily chart with a positive move witnessed to move past the critical 50EMA level of the \u20b9444 zone to improve the bias, anticipating a further rise. With the RSI on the rise, indicating strength, there is much upside potential visible to carry on with the positive move further ahead; we suggest buying the stock for an initial upside target of \u20b9468, keeping the stop loss of \u20b9440.\n\n7] Data Patterns: Buy at \u20b93088, target \u20b93260, stop loss \u20b93020.\n\nThe stock has witnessed a strong pullback with a strong bias maintained. Currently, with decent volume participation and positive bullish candle formation on the daily chart, it has further strengthened the trend to anticipate a further rise in the coming sessions. With the chart pattern looking appealing, we suggest buying the stock for an initial upside target of \u20b93260, keeping the stop loss of \u20b93020.\n\n8] Amara Raja Energy: Buy at \u20b91371, target \u20b91440, stop loss \u20b91335.\n\nThe stock has indicated a series of higher low formations on the daily chart.

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to US Fed rate; five stocks to buy or sell on Tuesday \u2014 June 18\nStock market today: The Indian stock market continued to move into a narrow range movement with a positive bias and ended higher on Friday last week. The Nifty 50 index gained 66 points and closed at 23,465, while the BSE Sensex surged 181 points and ended at 76,992. The Bank Nifty index finished 155 points higher at 50,002. Cash market volumes on the NSE were higher at Rs.1.35 lakh crore. The broad market indices rose more than the Nifty even as the advance-decline ratio fell to 1.39:1.\n\nTrade setup for Tuesday On the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \u201cNifty continued to show range-bound action within 23,300 to 23,500 levels, and still, there are no early signs of any breakouts on either side. A decisive move above 23,500 levels is likely to open an upside breakout, and a slide below 23,300 levels could mean a chance of downside breakout of the range movement in the near term.\u201d\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Ashwin Ramani, Derivatives & Technical Analyst at SAMCO Securities, said, \"Bank Nifty recovered from the initial hiccup and rose steadily throughout the day to close at 50,002, up 155 points. Strong put writing was observed at the 50,000 Strike in Bank Nifty. At the same time, the call writers (Bears) too gave a tough fight to the put writers (Bulls) at the 50,000 Strike, leading them marginally at Friday's close. The options activity at this strike will provide cues about Bank Nifty's upcoming direction.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Indian stock market today, Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal, said, \"We expect the market uptrend to continue this week supported by positive macro trends, expectation of sustained government spending and policy continuity, healthy monsoon, and strong earnings.\"\n\nUS Fed rate cut in focus \u201cAs the US retail sales and US Fed officials speech are taking place today, the market is expected to trade range-bound and may take a cue from these important data from the US,\u201d said Avinash Gorakshkar, Head of Research at Profitmart Securities.\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts When it comes to stock recommendations, we turn to the expertise of Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager \u2014 Technical Research at Anand Rathi. They have identified five stocks that they believe are worth considering for your portfolio.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] TVS Motor: Buy at \u20b92504, target \u20b92650, stop loss \u20b92410.\n\nTVS Motor share is exhibiting bullish solid momentum, trading at an all-time high of \u20b92519. The recent breakout above the crucial resistance at \u20b92450 levels is a significant technical development supported by robust trading volumes, reinforcing the strength in the stock. The breakthrough suggests a potential continuation of the upward trend, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.\n\n2] Timken India: Buy at \u20b94579.35, target \u20b94850, stop loss \u20b94415.\n\nTimken India share is currently trading at \u20b94579.35. After minor falls and sideways consolidation, the stock has lately broken the neckline levels of \u20b94400 and is rising quickly on the upside with substantial volume. There are expectations of further upward movement, potentially reaching \u20b94850 levels. On the downside, considerable support is evident near \u20b94415.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 3] Birla Corporation: Buy at \u20b91575, target \u20b91650, stop loss \u20b91520.\n\nWe have seen significant support in this stock at around \u20b91520. So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen a reversal price action formation at the \u20b91575 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of \u20b91650 so traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b91530 for the target price of \u20b91650 in the near term.\n\n4] Punjab National Bank or PNB: Buy at \u20b9129, target \u20b9135, stop loss \u20b9124.\n\nIn the short term, the stock has seen a bullish reversal pattern. Technically, retrenchment could be possible until \u20b9135. So, holding the support level of \u20b9124, this stock can bounce toward \u20b9135 in the short term. Hence, the trader can use a stop loss of \u20b9124 for the target price of \u20b9135.\n\n5] ITC: Buy at \u20b9431, target \u20b9440, stop loss \u20b9425.\n\nWe have seen major support in this stock around \u20b9425. So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen a reversal price action formation at the \u20b9431 price level. It may continue its rally until its next resistance level of \u20b9440, so traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b9425 for the target price of \u20b9440 in the near term.",

Nifty continued to face stiff resistance around 23,400 to 23,500 levels, and immediate support is at 23,280 levels.\"\n\nSpeaking on the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Neeraj Sharma, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"The Bank Nifty index opened with a gap up but subsequently lost momentum and finally closed the day on a negative note at 49,847. Technically, the Bank Nifty, on a daily scale, has formed a bearish Marubozu candlestick pattern following the formation of a tri-star doji, indicating weakness. On the downside, immediate support for the index is placed near 49,000 levels, where the 21-DEMA is.\"\n\nOn the global triggers that may dictate the Indian stock market today, Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal, said, \"MarketMarket is hopefully waiting for a favourable union budget, which is likely to be announced next month. Sentiments were boosted after domestic inflation fell to a 1-year low, and domestic April IIP data came in better than expected. The market has been consolidating over the last few days with a positive bias and is slowly and gradually increasing. Robust domestic macros, healthy monsoon prediction, and strong earnings expectations will likely support the uptrend.\"\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Regarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended five buy or sell stocks.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Usha Martin: Buy at \u20b9415, target \u20b9440, stop loss \u20b9399.\n\nUsha Martin's daily chart analysis reveals a notable shift in market dynamics, transitioning from minor declines and sideways consolidation to a promising upside bounce. The current trading session reflects an up move, potentially signalling an upside breakout from a narrow range momentum. This development aligns with a positive short-term trend, further reinforced by a surge in trading volume.\n\n2] Grasim Industries: Buy at \u20b92458, target \u20b92580, stop loss \u20b92390.\n\nGrasim Industries' current stock price of approximately \u20b92395 reflects several promising indicators for traders and investors. The RSI (Relative Strength Index), which measures a stock's momentum and strength, is currently at a respectable 58.26 level. This suggests that GRASIM is in a healthy trading range and not overbought or oversold, indicating stability and potential for further upward movement.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 3] IGL: Buy at \u20b9487, target \u20b9510, stop loss \u20b9475.\n\nWe have seen significant support in this stock at around \u20b9475. So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen a reversal price action formation at the \u20b9487 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of \u20b9510. So, traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b9475 for the target price of \u20b9510 in the near term.\n\n4] HCL Technologies: Buy at \u20b91445, target \u20b91520, stop loss \u20b91410.\n\nIn the short term, the stock has seen a bullish reversal pattern; technically, a reduction could be possible until \u20b91520. So, holding the support level of \u20b91410, this stock can bounce toward \u20b91520 in the short term. Hence, the trader can use a stop loss of \u20b91410 for the target price of \u20b91520.\n\n5] Mahindra & Mahindra or M&M: Buy at \u20b92870, target \u20b92930, stop loss \u20b92830.\n\nWe have seen significant support in this stock at around \u20b92830.

So, there will be just one rate cut in 2024, which is not good news for other than the bond and currency market.

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to global markets, five stocks to buy or sell on Wednesday \u2014 June 12\nStock market today: Following the mixed trend in the global markets, the Indian stock market erased all its gains in the closing bell on Tuesday. The Nifty 50 index, which represents the performance of the top 50 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), ended marginally higher at 23,264, while the BSE Sensex, which is a benchmark index that tracks the performance of the 30 largest and most actively traded stocks on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), finished 33 points lower at 76,456. The Bank Nifty index, which represents the banking sector, ended 75 points southward at 49,705. Cash market volumes on the NSE were lower at \u20b91.25 lakh crore. The broad market indices ended positively, even as the advance-decline ratio fell marginally to 1.72:1.\n\nTrade setup for Wednesday On the outlook for the Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"Nifty today is placed at the hurdle of 23,400 to 23,500 levels, which are weighing heavy for the market to sustain the new all-time highs. Hence, there is a possibility of a dip in the market. Immediate support for the Nifty 50 index is at 23,050 levels.\"\n\nSpeaking on the outlook for Bank Nifty today, Om Mehra, Technical Analyst at SAMCO Securities, said, \"The Bank Nifty ended the session at 49,705.75, down by 0.15%, forming a bearish candle with a small body. The index failed to surpass the 50,000 level but remains above its short-term moving average. There could be slight weakness if the index slips below 49,600, leading to a test of the 49,300 to 49,100 levels. However, the primary trend remains strong as long as the 49,000 level is sustained. Bank Nifty might continue to consolidate for a few more days.\"\n\nTriggers from global markets Speaking on the global triggers that may dominate the Indian stock market today, Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal, said, \"Globally, investors are cautiously awaiting US CPI data and US Fed policy outcome, which will be released today. US Fed commentary could provide direction to the market. So far, investors are baking in 1 rate cut towards the end of the year, so any deviation from that could drive the market on either side.\"\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Regarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended five buy or sell stocks.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Polycab India: Buy at \u20b96998, target \u20b97540, stop loss \u20b96730.\n\nThe current trading price of POLYCAB is \u20b96997.90. The stock has recently been ready for a breakout of Range on the daily chart, with a significant increase in trading volume indicating a potential breakout. If the price manages to close above the \u20b97000 level, it may have the potential to reach short-term targets of \u20b97540. On the other hand, immediate support levels are located at \u20b96900. These levels can be considered opportunities to buy on dips.\n\n2] Whirlpool: Buy at \u20b91741.25, target \u20b91830, stop loss \u20b91680.\n\nWHIRLPOOL daily chart analysis offers a favourable view for the following week, indicating a steady higher advance. Notably, the stock has produced a notable higher high and higher low pattern in the weekly frame, and the company's recent upward swing has effectively violated the neckline, establishing a new week high. This breakthrough indicates the possibility of a significant follow-through upward increase in the stock price.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 3] ICICI Bank: Buy at \u20b91118, target \u20b91160, stop loss \u20b91100.\n\nWe have seen significant support in this stock at around \u20b91100. So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen a reversal price action formation at the \u20b91100 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of \u20b91160. So traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b91100 for the target price of \u20b91160 in the near term.\n\n4] Berger Paints: Buy at \u20b9494, target \u20b9520, stop loss \u20b9480.\n\nIn the short term, the stock has seen a bullish reversal pattern. Technically, retrenchment could be possible until \u20b9520. So, holding the support level of \u20b9480, this stock can bounce toward \u20b9520 in the short term. Hence, the trader can use a stop loss of \u20b9480 for the target price of \u20b9520.\n\n5] Tata Motors: Buy at \u20b9986, target \u20b91020, stop loss \u20b9955.\n\nWe have seen significant support in this stock, around \u20b9986. So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen a reversal price action formation at the \u20b9986 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of \u20b91020. So, traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b9955 for the target price of \u20b91020 in the near term.",

Despite moving into all-time highs, the market is failing to gather strength to move up further,\" adding, \"The near-term trend of Nifty remains positive. However, having placed at the crucial hurdle around 23,300 levels, the chances of downward correction could be high in the short term. Immediate support is at 23100 levels.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"The Bank Nifty index opened on a flat note and maintained strength in the first half; however, in the second half, the index witnessed profit booking and finally settled the day on a flat to negative note at 49,781 levels. Technically, on the weekly scale, the index has formed a hanging man candlestick pattern. As per this pattern, 51,130-51,140 will act as resistance for the index.

However, the India VIX Index gained 0.49 percent and finished at 16.88. The small-cap index ended 2.18 percent higher in the broad market, whereas the mid-cap index finished 1.28 percent.\n\nModi Cabinet 2024 in focus On Modi 3.0 effect on the Indian stock market, Avinash Gorakshkar, Head of Research at Profitmart Securities, said, \"The Modi 3.0 government has come in place after the oath ceremony of the Modi cabinet on Sunday evening. As the oath ceremony signals that the government will remain under the stronghold of the BJP, the Indian stock market is expected to take this positively, and we may see the extension of the positive bias on Monday deals.\"\n\nTrade setup for Monday On the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The short-term trend of Nifty continues to be positive. Having reached the overhead resistance of around 23,300 to 23,400 levels, there is a possibility of a minor dip in the market from the highs in the short term, and that could be a buying opportunity. Immediate support for Nifty today is placed at 22,900 levels.\"\n\nSpeaking on the outlook for Bank Nifty today, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said, \"Bank Nifty has shown bullish momentum, taking support near its 10-day moving average and forming a bullish engulfing candle on the daily chart. It closed near its resistance level, indicating strong buying interest. The key resistance level for Bank Nifty is 50,500, while 49,200 will act as crucial support. This setup suggests the potential for further upward movement if the resistance is breached.\"\n\nSpeaking on the outlook for the Indian stock market today, Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal, said, \"Global cues have added to the positivity with European Central Bank announcing interest rate cut by 25 bps for the first time in nearly five years, moving faster than its US and UK counterparts. Now, hopes have revived that the US Fed might cut interest rates in the September meeting based on recent macro data points. Next week, we will focus on allocating key cabinet portfolios such as finance, defence, roads, energy, commerce, and railways. The market will continue to be volatile with upward biasedness.\"\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Speaking on stocks to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended five stocks to buy or sell on Monday.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] TVS Motor: Buy at \u20b92407.65, target \u20b92525, stop loss \u20b92323.\n\nTCS Motor daily chart analysis reveals a notable shift in market dynamics, transitioning from a period of minor declines and sideways consolidation to a promising upside bounce.

The recent breakout above the crucial resistance at \u20b94777 levels is a significant technical development supported by robust trading volumes, reinforcing the strength of the stock. The breakthrough suggests a potential continuation of the upward trend, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 3] Equitas Small Finance Bank: Buy at \u20b997.25, target \u20b9105.30, stop loss \u20b993.\n\nThe banking stock looks positive on the chart pattern and may show some upside soon.\n\n4] Sobha: Buy at \u20b92086, target \u20b92255, stop loss \u20b91985.\n\nThe realty stock has made a strong base at around \u20b91985 and has given a strong positive move after making a base around this level. In this bull trend, one can expect the stock to touch the \u20b92255 range.\n\n5] LT Foods: Buy at \u20b9244.65, target \u20b9270, stop loss \u20b9235.\n\nLT Foods shares have made a strong positive move after making a base at around \u20b9235.

The Nifty 50 index gained 201 points and closed at 22,821, while the BSE Sensex shot up 692 points and ended at 75,074. The Bank Nifty index scaled 237 points northward and finished at 49,291. The broad market indices outshined the frontline Indian indices even as the advance-decline ratio rose to 6.29:1.\n\nTrade setup for Friday Speaking on the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The short-term trend of the Nifty 50 index continues to be positive amidst high volatility. Having recently moved above the hurdle of 22,250 levels (midpart of Tuesday'sTuesday's long bear candle), the Nifty could move towards the next upper hurdle of 23,200 (upper part of the long bear candle) in the near term. Immediate support for Nifty today is placed at 22,640 levels.\"\n\nOn today's outlook for the Bank Nifty, Om Mehra, Technical Analyst at SAMCO Securities, said, \"The Bank Nifty ended the session at 49,291.90, up by 0.48%. It is currently holding above the 20-day and 50-day moving averages. The index closed above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement, which remains at 49,180, providing a solid base. The immediate resistance is placed at 49,700, and crossing this level might push the index to the 50,200 - 50,350 levels. The daily chart's Relative Strength Index (RSI) has yet to show a positive crossover; once this occurs, we can expect a stronger bullish momentum to follow.\"\n\nAsked about the reason for a rally on Dalal Street, Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal, said, \"Investors heaved a sigh of relief as the confidence strengthened post two key allies pledged their support to form a new government with the BJP. Even global factors contributed to today's rally as hopes revived for a rate cut possibility in the US Fed's September meeting after weaker-than-expected jobs data. All eyes will be on government formation this weekend along with RBI policy outcome and commentary today.\"\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Regarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended five buy or sell stocks.\n\nSumeet Bagadia'sBagadia's stocks to buy today 1] VA Tech Wabag: Buy at \u20b91078, target \u20b91150, stop loss \u20b91035.\n\nVA Tech Wabag is exhibiting bullish solid momentum, trading at an all-time high of \u20b91087.

On the hourly chart, support is indicated at 47,300 levels, while resistance is placed at 49,650, followed by 50,050. A pullback towards the 48,500 zone presents a good buying opportunity for the short-term traders.\"\n\nSpeaking on the triggers driving the Indian stock market, Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal, said, \"Expectation of healthy monsoon is driving buying interest in FMCG and Auto stocks. The narrative around government formation and RBI monetary policy would take centre stage in the near term. Despite the reduced seats, we expect the government focus to continue on Investment-led growth, Capex, Infrastructure creation, Manufacturing, etc in the long term.\"\n\n\"In the near term, we expect the market to remain obsessed with government formation exercise, with a keen eye on key cabinet portfolios such as Finance, Defense, Roads, Energy, Commerce, and Railways. With election overhang done, we expect the focus to revert to fundamental,\" Khemka added.\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts On stocks to buy today, stock market experts \u2014 Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager \u2014 Technical Research at Anand Rathi \u2014 recommended five buy or sell stocks for today.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Zydus Wellness: Buy at \u20b91895.35, target \u20b91999, stop loss \u20b91830.\n\nZydus Wellness share is showing strong bullish momentum, currently trading at a 52-week high of \u20b91859.35.

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to India VIX, five stocks to buy or sell on Wednesday \u2014 June 5\nStock market today: Following the sell-off trigger after the disappointing Lok Sabha Election results, the Indian stock market crashed heavily on Tuesday. The Nifty 50 index tumbled to its worst-ever session in over four years. The 50-stock index crashed 1379 points and finished at 21,884. The BSE Sensex tanked 4,389 points and ended at 72,079. The Bank Nifty index nosedived 4,051 points and closed at 46,928. Cash market volumes on the NSE rose to a record high of \u20b92.71 lakh crore. The broad market indices fell more than the frontline Indian indices even as the advance-decline ratio touched a low of 0.10:1 \u2013 the lowest since March 13, 2024.\n\nTrade setup on Wednesday On the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The short-term trend of Nifty is highly volatile with negative bias. Immediate support is placed for Nifty around 21250 levels (20-day EMA). Once election result volatility settles down, the market could find direction for the near term. There is a possibility of an upside bounce in the Nifty from near 21,250 to 21,000 levels.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said, \"Bank Nifty has also broken down from the rising channel, indicating a change in trend. We expect the Bank Nifty to correct towards 46150 \u2013 44000, which is the 200-day moving average and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the rise from 32300 \u2013 51100. On the upside, 48600 \u2013 49200 shall act as an immediate hurdle.\"\n\nExpecting the volatility in the Indian stock market to continue, Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, said, \" The India VIX Index has broken the hurdle placed at 25, and the index may touch 28 in the near term. So, the bumpy ride on Dalal Street may continue for a few more sessions.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Indian stock market today, Ajay Menon, MD & CEO of Broking & Distribution at Motilal Oswal, said, \"While the market volatility may continue in the near term, retail investors should take this correction as an opportunity to accumulate quality names in 3-4 tranches. Over the next few days, the narrative around government formation and RBI monetary policy would take centre stage.\"\n\nLok Sabha Election results effect On how the Lok Sabha Election 2024 results would impact Dalal Street on Wednesday, Amnish Aggarwal, Director of Research at Prabhudas Lilladher, said, \"Indian electorate has given a fractured mandate in 2024 Lok Sabha elections after it gave BJP absolute majority in 2014 and 2019 elections which took markets by surprise resulting in ~6% cut in NIFTY. Although BJP failed to get an absolute majority, NDA victory in an environment of drought (last year), higher global inflation, and huge prevalence of freebies and loan waivers seems a commendable task. PM Modi is likely to be the only Indian leader after Pt. Nehru to win mandate thrice. We believe portfolio allocations and future policies of the NDA Govt will be key determinants of market movements. Severe jolt to BJP in Uttar Pradesh (new PDA social engineering), Maharashtra (fractured parties) and West Bengal will keep tricky reforms regarding PSU divestment, GST, labour laws, agriculture, modern retail/ Ecom at bay.\"\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts\n\nRegarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts \u2014 Sumeet Bagadia of Choice Broking and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager \u2014 Technical Research at Anand Rathi \u2014 recommended five stocks to buy or sell on Wednesday.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today\n\n1] Dabur: Buy at \u20b9578.20, target \u20b9611, stop loss \u20b9560.\n\nDabur share price is currently trading at \u20b9578.2.

On the downside, trend line support is nearing 50600 levels, with the recent breakout point at 49,975.\"\n\n\"The India VIX Index has retraced from its recent highs and came close to the 19 mark, which signifies rising confidence of investors in the Indian equity market. This happened after the Exit Polls gave the incumbent Narendra Modi government a third term. Suppose the actual Lok Sabha Election result comes in sync with the Exit Polls. In that case, we can witness further nosedive in the Indian VIX today, and the index may soon touch the 15 mark,\" said Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking.\n\nLok Sabha Election results in focus Expecting the current Indian stock market rally to continue further, Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal said, \"We expect the market to reach new highs given the clear majority for the ruling party in exit polls, good macro trends, and solid corporate earnings. One can focus on manufacturing, capex, infrastructure and financials as a long-term investment theme.\"\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts On stocks to buy today, stock market experts \u2014 Sumeet Bagadia of Choice Broking; Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager \u2014 Technical Research at Anand Rathi; and Shiju Koothupalakkal, Technical Research Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher \u2014 recommended eight stocks to buy or sell on Tuesday.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Reliance Industries: Buy at \u20b93020.65, target \u20b93240, stop loss \u20b92900.\n\nReliance share price is currently positioned at \u20b93020.65 levels, reflecting a solid foundation established at the support level of \u20b92900 which is also close to its 20 EMA levels.

        "text": "Trade setup for Nifty 50, Indian stock market today after exit poll, five stocks to buy or sell on Monday\nStock market today: After the end of Lok Sabha Election 2024 on Saturday last week, and most of the Exit Polls predict the third term for the Narendra Modi government in New Delhi, the Indian stock market is expected to remain volatile on Monday. On Friday last week, frontline Indian indices ended marginally higher after erasing most of its early morning losses. The Nifty 50 index finished 42 points higher at the 22,530 mark, while the BSE Sensex ended 75 points northward at 73,961. The Bank Nifty index gained 301 points and closed at 48,983. Cash market volumes on the NSE touched a record high of \u20b92.29 lakh crore \u2013 aided by trades for MSCI and FTSE rebalancing. The small-cap index rose 0.76 percent even as the advance-decline ratio improved to 0.81:1.\n\nTrade setup for Monday On the outlook for the Nifty today, Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities, said, \"The Nifty index could see volatile moves early this week based on the outcome of exit polls and later the actual Lok Sabha Election results. Today, it could stay in the 22,150 to 22,794 band.\"\n\nOn the outlook for Bank Nifty today, Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said, \"Bank Nifty continued with the momentum and closed in the positive for the second consecutive trading session. Daily and hourly momentum indicators have a positive crossover, a buy signal. Thus, we expect the momentum to continue. On the upside, crucial support is placed at 48,600 to 4,8500, while immediate hurdles are placed at 49,700 to 4,9800.\"\n\nExit Poll 2024 in focus Suggesting investors to remain vigilant about the next event like Lok Sabha Election results, numbers of seats BJP gets, etc., Dhiraj Relli, MD & CEO at HDFC Securities, said, \"Going by a majority of pollster's exit poll predictions, the NDA alliance could end up with 350-370 seats, enough to form the Govt for the third time and is in line with the median forecast ahead of the exit polls. However, this number is almost the same as that in 2019 and short of the 400+ target of the alliance,\" adding, \"Unless we get a surprise in the balance exit poll predictions, Indian markets may not react majorly to these numbers on a closing basis.\"\n\n\"The fact that the BJP could return to power is good for continuing and accelerating the reform process. This outcome was mainly on the expected lines. Hence, after the initial excitement, markets may wait out for the new path set out by the latest Govt,\" Relli said. The HDFC Securities expert went on to add that the NDA does not get 400+ setas, some fundamental reforms requiring constitutional amendments may be challenging to implement, but there is still a lot that can be done with this kind of majority.\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, recommended five stocks to buy or sell today.

The mid-cap index crashed 1.21 percent in the broad market, whereas the small-cap index nosedived 1.33 percent.\n\nTrade setup for Friday On the outlook for the Nifty 50 index, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said, \"The Nifty 50 index has remained volatile during the session with predominant bearishness. The sentiment for the short term remains weak as the index slipped below the critical 21-day Exponential Moving Average (21EMA). Call writing activity was significant at 22,500. Therefore, Nifty needs to sustain above 22,500 to witness a meaningful recovery. However, failure to move above 22,500 might attract fresh selling in the market, potentially driving the index towards 22,300/22,100.\"\n\nOn the outlook for Bank Nifty today, Neeraj Sharma, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"The Bank Nifty index opened on a negative note but after that witnessed a strong recovery, finally settling the day on a positive note at 48,682. As we mentioned, the index defended the support at 48,000 levels and witnessed a recovery. Technically, the Bank Nifty has defended the support of the 21-DEMA at 48,403 and found resistance near 49,000-49,050 levels. If the index sustains above 49,050, then the rally could stretch towards 49,690 and 50,000 levels.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Indian stock market today, Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal, said, \"Nervousness ahead of the exit poll on 1st June and weak global cues continue to dent sentiments. Global markets remained under pressure due to rising bond yields and denting hopes of a rate cut. We expect market volatility to heighten as we approach the general election outcome.\"\n\nSpeaking on the rising India VIX Index, Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, said, \"The India VIX Index has breached the immediate hurdle placed at 23, and the volatility index is now facing the hurdle at 25. On breaching this resistance on a closing basis, we can expect more volatility in the Indian stock market as the index may touch the 28 mark in the near term.\"\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Dixon Technologies: Buy at \u20b99308, target \u20b99900, stop loss \u20b99000.\n\nDixon Technologies share price is currently trading at \u20b99308, showcasing significant bullish momentum. The stock has recently achieved a decisive breakout above the \u20b99000 level, which now acts as a solid support zone after being retested. This consolidation above the breakout level indicates robust investor confidence and buying interest at these levels. Additionally, DIXON is trading above its short-term (20-day), medium-term (50-day), and long-term (200-day) Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), reinforcing its overall strength and positive trend.\n\n2] Ujjivan Small Finance Bank: Buy at \u20b9589.50, target \u20b9630, stop loss \u20b9568.\n\nThe current trading price of UJJIVAN is \u20b9589.5. The stock has recently formed a Rounding Breakout pattern on the daily chart with a significant increase in trading volume, indicating a potential breakout. If the price halves above the \u20b9590 level, it may reach short-term targets of \u20b9630. On the other hand, immediate support levels are located at \u20b9575 and \u20b9568. These levels can be considered as opportunities to buy on dips.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 3] PNB Housing Finance: Buy at \u20b9748, target \u20b9780, stop loss \u20b9720.\n\nWe have seen significant support in this stock at around \u20b9720. So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen a reversal price action formation at the \u20b9748 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of \u20b9780. So traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b9720 for the target price of \u20b9780 in the near term.\n\n4] BEL: Buy at \u20b9290, target \u20b9305, stop loss \u20b9282.\n\nIn the short term, the stock has seen a bullish reversal pattern. Technically, retrenchment could be possible until \u20b9305. So, holding the support level of \u20b9282, this stock can bounce toward \u20b9305 in the short term. Hence, the trader can use a stop loss of \u20b9282 for the target price of \u20b9305.\n\n5] Escorts: Buy at \u20b93856, target \u20b94050, stop loss \u20b93780.\n\nWe have seen major support in this stock at around \u20b93780.

So traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b93780 for the target price of \u20b94050 in the near term.",

The Nifty 50 index lost 183 points and closed at 22,704, the BSE Sensex finished 667 points lower at 74,502 whereas the Bank Nifty index crashed 640 points and ended at 48,501. Cash market volumes on the NSE were flat at Rs.1.03 lakh crore. The broad market indices fell less than the Nifty even as the advance-decline ratio improved to 0.74:1.\n\nTrade setup for Thursday On the outlook for Nifty today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"The domestic benchmark indices opened on a weaker note, weighed down by weak global cues, and as a result, Nifty settled the day on a negative note at 22,705 levels. Technically, the index confirmed a dark cloud cover candlestick pattern and witnessed profit booking. On the downside, the 21-DEMA is near 22,567, and the 34-DEMA is near 22,480. Thus, 22,567 and 22,480 will serve as support points for the index, while 22,800 and 23,110 will act as a major hurdle in the short term.\"\n\nOn the outlook for Bank Nifty today, Om Mehra, Technical Analyst at SAMCO Securities, said, \"Bank Nifty ended today's session at 48,501.35, down 1.30%. The bearish candle with a long tail indicates rejections in reaching the 49,000 level in Bank Nifty. The index is hovering near the 20 DMA (Daily Moving Average), and if it falls below 48,380, it could potentially push towards the 48,000 mark. Resistance is currently expected around the 49,000 level. In the broader context, a double-top formation is seen on the daily chart, generally indicating a reversal signal of bullish trend.\"\n\nUnveiling strategy for the Indian stock market today, Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal, said, \"The volatility is expected to heighten in coming sessions. Thus, traders should stay on the sidelines and not get too aggressive. The weak global cues are further adding to the nervousness, and thus markets will likely remain weak soon.\"\n\nSpeaking on the rising India VIX Index, Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, said, \"The India VIX Index has breached the immediate hurdle placed at 23, and the volatility index is now facing the hurdle at 25.

Notably, it holds a robust support level at \u20b96850, just below its 20-day EMA levels, signifying historical strength and the potential to attract buyers, indicating short-term bullish sentiment. The daily chart reveals a robust bullish pattern, suggesting an uptrend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) comfortably trading near 57.95 further supports the case for strength, as it indicates that the stock is not overbought, leaving room for potential gains.\n\n2] Zydus Wellness: Buy at \u20b91801.45, target \u20b91900, stop loss \u20b91740.\n\nZydus Wellness shares' daily chart analysis offers a favourable view for the following week, indicating a steady higher advance. Notably, the stock has produced a notable higher high and higher low pattern, and the company's recent upward swing has effectively violated the neckline, establishing a new week high. This breakthrough indicates the possibility of a significant follow-through upward increase in the stock price.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 3] Bharat Forge: Buy at \u20b91570, target \u20b91620, stop loss \u20b91540.\n\nWe have seen major support in this stock at around \u20b91540.

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to India VIX, five stocks to buy or sell on Wednesday \u2014 May 29\nStock market today: Following weak global cues, the Indian stock market ended lower for the third straight session. The Nifty 50 index, which represents the performance of the 50 largest and most liquid Indian companies, went down 44 points and closed at 22,888, whereas the BSE Sensex, which is a benchmark index of the Bombay Stock Exchange, shed 220 points and closed at 75,170. The Bank Nifty index, which represents the performance of the banking sector, lost 139 points and finished at 49,142.\n\nCash market volumes on the NSE, which is the National Stock Exchange of India, fell nearly 16 percent compared to the previous day. The broad market indices fell more than the Nifty, even as the advance-decline ratio, which measures the number of advancing stocks to the number of declining stocks, dropped sharply to 0.4:1, indicating a bearish market sentiment.\"\n\nTrade setup for Wednesday Providing his expert analysis on the Nifty 50 index, Osho Krishan, a seasoned Sr. Analyst in Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One, stated, \"From a technical standpoint, there has been a subtle shift in the price chart for Nifty, but the recent small-bodied candlestick formations clearly indicated the exhaustion of the bullish strength and could trigger a price-wise correction post-rally. In terms of levels, 22800-22700 is likely to be seen as immediate support. Conversely, 23000 poses a significant hurdle, followed by the lifetime high zone around 23100.\"\n\nOn the outlook for Bank Nifty today, Om Mehra, Technical Analyst at SAMCO Securities, said, \"Bank Nifty halted its gaining streak, ending the session at 49,142.15, down 0.28%. The appearance of a shooting star on the daily chart in the previous session suggests higher-level resistance. A break below the immediate support level of 49,100 could push the index towards 48,800. For the uptrend to resume, Bank Nifty must decisively break above the 49,400 mark.\"\n\nWhen asked about the outlook of the Indian stock market today, Siddhartha Khemka, the Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal, expressed, \"We anticipate Nifty to maintain a sideways to marginally positive trend, buoyed by reduced FII selling, predictions of above-normal monsoon, and the last leg of Q4 results. These factors could potentially open up profitable opportunities for investors.\"\n\nExpecting the volatility to continue further on Dalal Street, Rahul Ghose, CEO of Hedged.in said, \"The rise in India VIX after forming the day low at 22.03 gradually increased to test the day's high at 24.48 and likely to close around the high, build pressure on Nifty on the upside, which traded, below the opening range 22957 to 22992, most of the day. The bearish OI build-up in 23000 Calls indicates that 23000 shall be a hurdle for Nifty to cross in the last expiry week of the May series.\"\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts For those seeking stock recommendations, market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi, have carefully selected five stocks for potential buy or sell opportunities, ensuring a comprehensive and well-informed approach.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Hero MotoCorp: Buy at \u20b95185, target \u20b95525, stop loss \u20b95020.\n\nHero MotoCorp's share price is currently \u20b95185. It recently consolidated within \u20b94965 to \u20b95200 levels and exhibits signs of a bullish trend, indicating a potential bullish breakout accompanied by robust trading volume. However, it's important to note that there are risks associated with this trade, such as a potential decrease in stock prices if the bullish trend reverses. Buying on dips is recommended within the range of \u20b95100 levels.\"\n\n2] Muthoot Finance: Buy at \u20b91745.40, target \u20b91850, stop loss \u20b91685.\n\nMuthoot Finance share is currently trading at \u20b91745.4. After minor falls and sideways consolidation, the stock has lately broken the neckline levels of \u20b91720 and is rising quickly on the upside with substantial volume. There are expectations of further upward movement, potentially reaching \u20b91850 levels. On the downside, considerable support is evident near \u20b91685.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 3] HDFC Life: Buy at \u20b9578, target \u20b9600, stop loss \u20b9560.\n\nWe have seen significant support in this stock, around \u20b9560. So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen a reversal price action formation at the \u20b9578 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of \u20b9600. So, traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b9560 for the target price of \u20b9600 in the near term.\n\n4] HCL Technologies: Buy at \u20b91358, target \u20b91420, stop loss \u20b91320.\n\nIn the short term, the stock has seen a bullish reversal pattern. Technically, retrenchment could be possible until \u20b91420. This means that the stock's price could potentially decrease before it starts to increase. So, holding the support level of \u20b91320, this stock can bounce toward \u20b91420 in the short term. Hence, the trader can use a stop loss of \u20b91320 for the target price of \u20b91420. It's important to note that the stock's price could be influenced by current market trends, such as changes in investor sentiment or economic conditions.\"\n\n5] Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy at \u20b91698, target \u20b91740, stop loss \u20b91665.\n\nWe have seen significant support in this stock, around \u20b91665. So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen a reversal price action formation at the \u20b91698 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of \u20b91740. This means that the stock's price could potentially increase due to positive financial performance. So, traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b91665 for the target price of \u20b91740 in the near term. It's important to note that the stock's price could be influenced by the company's financial performance, such as its quarterly earnings or revenue growth.\"",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to India VIX, eight stocks to buy or sell on Tuesday \u2014 May 28\nStock market today: Despite strong global market sentiments, the Indian stock market ended flat on Monday. The Nifty 50 index finished 24 points lower at 22,932 after touching a new peak of 23,110 mark. The BSE Sensex ended 19 points lower at the 75,390 mark after touching a new lifetime high of 76,009. However, the Bank Nifty index gained 310 points and closed at 49,281. Cash market volumes on the NSE were flat compared to the previous day. The mid-cap index closed 0.63 percent higher even as the advance-decline ratio remained negative at 0.62:1.\n\nTrade setup for Tuesday On the outlook for Nifty today, Osho Krishan, Sr. Analyst - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One, said, \"The Nifty 50 index has reverted from the upper band of the 'Rising Channel', suggesting a potent resilience in the near term. Also, the advance-decline ratio favouring the bears portrays the exhaustion among the bulls. At the current juncture, the upper band of the channel placed around 23150-23200 is likely to be an intermediate hurdle. On the other hand, the neckline of the breakout around 22800-22750 is expected to provide a cushion to the benchmark. For now, the index is likely to hover within the range above with bullish biases, and one needs to act accordingly and use proper risk management.\"\n\nOn the outlook for Bank Nifty today, here is Rahul Ghose, CEO of Hedged. Said, \"Bank Nifty showed strength and managed to trade above the opening range for the day 49050 to 49220; it traded above the CPR throughout the day, which indicates the upward momentum continues to be strong. The change in OI shows the increased ITM Put writing for the strike 49500 and below levels. The PCR opened at 1.12 levels made the high at 1.39 in the mid-session, to fall & close for the day at 0.98.\"\n\nThe India VIX index performed well for the day. In the opening range, it tested 18.44 on the downside and 26.2 on the upside. Although it remained flat for most of the session, it managed to close 7 percent higher at 23.36 than last week's levels.\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Regarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts \u2014 Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking; Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager \u2014 Technical Research at Anand Rathi; and Shiju Koothupalakkal, Technical Research Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher \u2014 recommended eight buy or sell stocks for today.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Indian Hotels Company or IHC: Buy at \u20b9581, target \u20b9618, stop loss \u20b9560.\n\nIndian Hotels share price is currently trading at \u20b9581, displaying a ready breakout of a rounding bottom chart pattern with significant volume, indicating strong bullish momentum. Additionally, the stock is positioned above key Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), including the 20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day EMAs. This alignment above crucial EMAs strengthens the bullish outlook, suggesting the potential for sustained upward price movement.\n\n2] Godrej Consumer Products: Buy at \u20b91329, target \u20b91410, stop loss \u20b91290.\n\nGodrej Consumer Products Limited (GODREJCP) has exhibited a notable resurgence in its stock price. It recently rebounded from a support level at \u20b91290, which is also close to its 20-day EMA levels, and is presently trading at around \u20b91328.95. The fact that the stock trades above all the essential Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) suggests significant strength.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today 3] Infosys: Buy at \u20b91472, taret \u20b91520, stop loss \u20b91430.\n\nWe have seen major support in Infosys's share, around \u20b91430. So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen a reversal price action formation at the \u20b91472 price level, which may continue its rally until its next resistance level of \u20b91520. So, traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b91430 for the target price of \u20b91520 in the near term.\n\n4] Voltas: Buy at \u20b91408, target \u20b91450, stop loss \u20b91380.\n\nIn the short term, the stock has seen a bullish reversal pattern. Technically, retrenchment could be possible until \u20b91450. So, holding the support level of \u20b91380, this stock can bounce toward \u20b91450 in the short term. Hence, the trader can use a stop loss of \u20b91380 for the target price of \u20b91450.\n\n5] Bank of Baroda: Buy at \u20b9270, target \u20b9282, stop loss \u20b9263.\n\nWe have seen strong support in this stock, around 263 rupees. So, at the current juncture, BoB share price has again seen reversal price action and bullish candlestick pattern formation at the \u20b9270 price level, which may continue its rally until its next resistance level of \u20b9282. Hence, traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b9263 for the target price of \u20b9282 in the near term.\n\nShiju Koothupalakkal's buy or sell stocks 6] Jindal Saw: Buy at \u20b9565.75, target \u20b9587, stop loss \u20b9554.\n\nThe stock has indicated a series of higher lows on the daily chart. Currently, with a positive bullish candle formation on the daily chart, it has improved the bias. With the RSI well placed, it has much upside potential to carry on with the positive move further ahead. We suggest buying the stock for an initial upside target of \u20b9587, keeping the stop loss of \u20b9554.\n\n7] Bank of India: Buy at \u20b9132.45, target \u20b9140, stop loss \u20b9129.50.\n\nAfter the decent erosion, the stock has witnessed consolidation, taking support near the \u20b9121 zone. It has indicated a decent pullback to improve the bias, anticipating a further rise. The RSI reversing from the highly oversold zone has signalled a buy, and with the chart looking good, we suggest buying the stock for an initial upside target of \u20b9140, keeping the stop loss of \u20b9129.50.\n\n8] AU Small Finance Bank: Buy at \u20b9634.60, target \u20b9665, stop loss \u20b9622.\n\nAfter taking support near the \u20b9600 zone for the second time, the stock has indicated a pullback to move past the 50EMA level of the \u20b9621 zone to improve the bias, and further rise can be anticipated. The RSI is well placed, indicating a trend reversal after the gradual slide, and has much upside potential to carry on with the positive move further ahead. We suggest buying the stock for an initial upside target of \u20b9665, keeping the stop loss of \u20b9622.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to Sensex, eight stocks to buy or sell on Monday \u2014 May 27\nStock market today: After making fresh highs in early morning trade, the Indian stock market settled flat on Friday last week. The Nifty 50 index settled at 22,957 after climbing to a new peak of 23,026. The BSE Sensex went off 7 points and ended at 75,410, while the Bank Nifty index finished 203 points higher at 48,971. The mid-cap index closed 0.23 percent higher even as the advance-decline ratio fell to 0.66:1. This stability in the market indicates a secure and confident environment for traders and investors.\n\nTrade setup for Monday On the outlook for Nifty today, Ruchit Jain, Lead Research, 5paisa.com, a trusted expert in the field, said, \"The overall trend continues to be positive as there are no signs of reversal yet. The higher end of the channel and the retracement levels indicate an initial hurdle in the range of 23,050 to 23,150 in the coming week, and once this is crossed, we could see a continuation of the rally towards the 23,400 to 23,500 zone. On the flip side, the immediate support for Nifty today is around 22,700, followed by 22,500.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Neeraj Sharma, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C. Mehta, said, \"The Bank Nifty index opened on a negative note, but after an initial dip, the index witnessed buying interest, which helped it to settle the day on a positive note at 48,972 levels. Technically, Bank Nifty broke the short-term resistance of 48,260 levels and closed above it, indicating strength. If the index holds above 48,000 levels, we expect it to test levels of 49,500. Thus, a buy-on-dips approach should be adopted in Bank Nifty.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Indian stock market today, Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com said, \"Traders are advised to continue to trade with a positive bias and look for buying opportunities on any declines. INDIA VIX remains high due to the event (elections results) ahead, but it should start cooling off if the actual event outcome does not deviate much from the expectations.\"\n\n\"Overall, we expect the market to witness a gradual up-move and see some volatility next week as both election and earning season are nearing the end,\" said Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal.\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts\n\nRegarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts \u2014 Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking; Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager \u2014 Technical Research at Anand Rathi; and Shiju Koothupalakkal, Technical Research Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladherhave \u2014 recommended eight buy or sell stocks for today.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today\n\n1] Tata Steel: Buy at \u20b9175, target \u20b9185, stop loss \u20b9169.\n\nThe daily chart analysis of TATASTEEL reveals a promising outlook for the upcoming week, signalling a sustained upward movement.

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to India VIX, five stocks to buy or sell on Friday \u2014 May 24\nStock market today: The domestic benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are likely to have a negative start on Friday's trading session, amid weak global cues.\n\nThe Indian benchmark indices is off to a tepid start, based on Gift Nifty's trends. The Gift Nifty was trading at 22,966.00, a discount of around 42 points from the previous closing of the Nifty futures, at 23,008.00\n\nThe Nifty 50 ended over 22,900 on Thursday, marking a new high for the domestic equities indices.\n\nThe Nifty 50 closed 369.85 points, or 1.64%, higher at 75,418.04, while the Sensex surged 1,196.98 points, or 1.61%, to conclude at 22,967.65.\n\nThe headline index saw a record rise, according to Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, with prominent industries like banking and autos outperforming. Bond rates should decrease as a result of the RBI's historic payout, which is comparable to an indirect rate drop. Thanks in part to the robust increase shown by the composite HSBC PMI data for May, the broader market continued to be optimistic. The early arrival of the southwest monsoon has helped the domestic market, which has lagged behind other emerging markets in the previous two months.\n\nTrade setup for Friday According to Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, the Nifty 50 saw a clear breakthrough above its extended consolidation on the daily timeframe, indicating a sharp uptick in confidence. The index is only 7 points shy of 23,000 after making a calculated move in that direction. After a sizable green candle formed on the daily chart, the trend seemed to be quite strong. In the short run, the index may go towards 23,500 if it stays above 23,000. Support is placed at 22,800 on the bottom end; the strength may hold as long as it stays above 22,800.\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Buy or sell stocks for today comes from Sumeet Bagadia of Choice Broking and Shiju Koothupalakkal of Prabhudas Lilladher. Under the names of the experts, these stocks are arranged and further described.\n\nShiju Koothupalakkal's shares to buy today Shiju Koothupalakkal - Technical Research Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd\n\n1. Shriram Finance Ltd: Buy at \u20b9 2,400, target \u20b9 2,510, stop loss \u20b9 2,350 The stock after the consolidation has indicated a bullish candle formation on the daily chart to improve the bias, and with the RSI gradually on the rise, indicating strength, it has indicated a trend reversal with much upside potential to carry on with the positive move further ahead. We suggest buying the stock for an initial upside target of \u20b92,510, keeping the stop loss of \u20b92,350.\n\n2. Tata Motors Ltd: Buy at \u20b9 962, target \u20b9 1,000, stop loss \u20b9 942 The stock has indicated a pullback, with a positive candle formation on the daily chart to improve the bias and anticipate a further rise. The RSI is currently well placed and has indicated a trend reversal to signal a buy, with a potential upside move anticipated in the coming days. We suggest buying the stock for an initial upside target of 1,000 while keeping the stop loss of \u20b9942.\n\n3. Chennai Petroleum Corporation Ltd: Buy at \u20b9 939, target \u20b9 977, stop loss \u20b9 918 The stock, after the consolidation taking support near the 838 zone, has indicated a bullish candle formation on the daily chart to improve the bias, and with the RSI gradually on the rise, indicating strength, it has indicated a trend reversal with much upside potential to carry on with the positive move further ahead. We suggest to buy the stock for an initial upside target of \u20b9977, keeping the stop loss of \u20b9918.\n\nSumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking 4. Bajaj Auto Ltd: Buy at \u20b9 8,963.45, target \u20b9 9,470, stop loss \u20b9 8,700 As of May 23, 2024, Bajaj Auto is presently trading at \u20b98,963. It has recently broken out of a daily trendline with significant volume. This upward momentum is supported by a consistent pattern of higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart, accompanied by robust trading volume. These patterns underscore a resilient upward trajectory in the stock.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 53.83 and is trending upward, indicating a significant surge in buying momentum. Both RSI and Stochastic RSI in the overbought region suggest that positional traders may consider holding their positions and implementing a trailing stop-loss.\n\nThe overall trend for Bajaj Auto is bullish, with confluence from various technical indicators reinforcing the optimistic outlook. Given these signals, there is potential for the stock to attain target prices of \u20b99,470 in the near term.\n\nIt is advisable to consider buying on dips, particularly around \u20b98,800, to capitalise on potential retracements in the stock price. To prudently manage risk, implementing a stop-loss (SL) at \u20b98,700 is recommended. This precautionary measure is crucial to safeguard investments in the event of an unexpected market reversal.\n\n5. State Bank of India (SBI): Buy at \u20b9 832.10, target \u20b9 870, stop loss \u20b9 812 State Bank of India is currently positioned at a crucial juncture in its trading dynamics. With a robust support base at 812 levels, near its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), the stock stands resilient. Trading at approximately 832.10 levels, SBIN exhibits strength by maintaining levels above key moving averages.\n\nThe charts unveil a minor resistance barrier at 840 levels, a threshold the stock needs to surpass to pave the way for an upward trajectory. A successful breach of this resistance can potentially propel State Bank of India towards its target price of 870 and beyond. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at a comfortable 61.67 further bolsters the case for strength in the stock.\n\nInvestors and traders alike should closely monitor State Bank of India's performance around the noted levels, as a breakout from the resistance can signify a bullish phase, offering potential opportunities for those eyeing upward movements in the stock.\n\nBased on the above technical analysis we recommend buying State Bank of India at current market price of \u20b9832.10 with a stop loss of \u20b9812 for the target of \u20b9870.",

Within a rising channel, the index has been climbing. As long as it continues over 22,500, the trend is probably going to continue being strong. With immediate support at 22,600, the index may climb higher in the near future, maybe as high as 22,800. If the index falls below 22,600, it may momentarily go up near 22,500.\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Prabhudas Lilladher's Shiju Koothupalakkal, and Choice Broking's Sumeet Bagadia have suggested a total of five buy or sell stocks for today. These stocks are arranged and explained further under the names of the experts.\n\nShiju Koothupalakkal's shares to buy today Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager - Technical Research at Anand Rathi\n\n1.

GMR Airports Infrastructure: Buy at \u20b9 87.50, target \u20b9 92, stop loss \u20b9 86 The stock recently has picked up well from the significant 50EMA level of 82.70 to improve the bias and with the RSI on the rise indicating strength has much upside potential to carry on with the positive move further ahead.

Divi's Laboratories: Buy at 4,058.55, target \u20b9 4,375, stop loss \u20b9 3,890 Based on a comprehensive technical analysis, Divi's Lab is currently trading at 4,058.55, exhibiting significant strength. The stock has found substantial support at the 3,890 level, which is close to its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Trading above key EMAs, including the 20, 50, and 200-day averages, Divi's Lab indicates a positive trend and a favourable outlook for investors.\n\nThe stock's ability to stay above these crucial moving averages suggests a robust bullish sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 66.40, further reinforcing the upward momentum. An RSI above 60 generally indicates a strong trend, aligning with the bullish sentiment observed in recent trading sessions.\n\nOverall, the technical indicators suggest that Divi's Lab is well-positioned for continued strength. Investors might consider this stock a promising candidate for their portfolios, given its upward trajectory and solid support levels. However, it is always advisable to keep an eye on market conditions and set appropriate stop-loss levels to manage risk effectively.\n\nGiven these indicators, it is advisable to consider Divi's Lab as a potential buy opportunity, with an anticipated target price of 4,375. To manage risk, a stop-loss order should be placed at 3,890, providing a prudent level of protection for the investment.\n\n5. Infosys: Buy at 1,454.8, target \u20b9 1,542, stop loss \u20b9 1,411 Infosys is currently valued at \u20b91,454.8. It recently consolidated at the bottom and formed a bullish engulfing pattern, suggesting a bullish reversal, accompanied by robust trading volume. These patterns indicate a strong potential upward trajectory in the stock.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) presently stands at 52 and is trending upwards, suggesting a significant surge in buying momentum. Both the RSI and Stochastic RSI are in the overbought region, indicating that positional traders may consider holding their positions and implementing a trailing stop-loss.\n\nThe overall trend for Infosys is bullish, with various technical indicators reinforcing the optimistic outlook. Given these signals, there is potential for the stock to reach target prices of \u20b91,542 in the near term.\n\nIt is advisable to consider buying on dips, especially around \u20b91,435, to capitalize on potential retracements in the stock price. To prudently manage risk, implementing a stop-loss (SL) at \u20b91,411 is recommended. This precautionary measure is crucial to safeguard investments in the event of an unexpected market reversal.",

It is important to understand that this landmark has been achieved when the market is almost flat trading in a range. This means the contribution to the up move in market cap has come from the broader market. PSUs have contributed significantly to this achievement,\u201d said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services.\n\nTrade setup for Wednesday On the Nifty outlook, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities, said, \"The index remained within the range of 22,400 and 22,600. Strong put writing at 22,400 and 22,500 might provide support to the Nifty. On the higher end, a decisive move above 22,600 might induce a rally towards 22,800 in the near term. Till then the index might continue consolidating as long as it remains within the range of 22,400 to 22,600.\"\n\nOn the Bank Nifty outlook, Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities, said, \"The Bank Nifty index failed to surpass the mark of 48,400, where the 20DMA is placed. A break above this level will lead to a fresh move on the upside. The lower-end support is placed at 48,000, where the highest open interest is built up on the put side. The index needs to break these levels decisively on either side to have trending moves in the near term.\"\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Prabhudas Lilladher's Shiju Koothupalakkal, and Choice Broking's Sumeet Bagadia have suggested a total of five buy or sell stocks for today. These stocks are arranged and explained further under the names of the experts.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's shares to buy 1] Vedanta Ltd: Buy at \u20b9 491.7, target \u20b9 515, stop loss \u20b9 475 The daily chart analysis of Vedanta reveals a promising outlook for the upcoming week, signalling a sustained upward movement. Notably, the stock has formed a significant higher high and higher low pattern, and the recent upward swing has successfully breached the neckline, establishing a new week high for the stock. This breakout suggests the potential for a substantial follow-through upward movement in the stock price.\n\nAdding to the positive momentum, there has been an increase in trading volume, indicating growing market interest. The Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) for short term is 482. And NATIONALUM stock is trading above this level this is a good sign for the stock and it could move higher. VWAP is rising upwards. Furthermore, NATIONALUM is currently trading above its crucial 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) levels, reinforcing the bullish trend. Given the overall chart pattern, the analysis suggests a favourable long trading opportunity for investors.\n\nBased on the above analysis we recommend buying VEDL in cash at CMP of 491.7 for the target of 515 with a stop loss of 475.\n\n2] Tech Mahindra Ltd: Buy at \u20b9 1,323.90, target \u20b9 1,415, stop loss \u20b9 1,280 Tech Mahindra, a prominent player in the technology sector, has demonstrated resilience by bouncing back from the support level of 1280, which aligns closely with its 20-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Currently trading at 1323.90 per share, the stock has recently broken above the 1320 level, signalling robust strength. This positive sentiment is further reinforced as TECHM trades above its 20, 50, and 200-day moving averages, a clear indication of bullish momentum.\n\nThe stock faces a minor resistance at 1345 levels. Sustaining above this resistance could trigger additional upward momentum, paving the way for further gains. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is presently at 64.53 and trending upwards, highlighting increased buying activity and further supporting the bullish outlook.\n\nGiven these technical indicators, TECHM presents a compelling investment opportunity. The combination of a strong bounce from support, a significant breakout, and favourable RSI readings makes it an attractive prospect for investors looking to capitalize on its upward trajectory.\n\nInvestors should be cautious and keep a watch on the stock if it falls below 1280, as this could negate the positive outlook. A short-term target of 1415 is achievable.\n\nShiju Koothupalakkal's buy or sell stocks 3] Railtel Corporation of India Ltd: Buy at \u20b9 433, target \u20b9 455, stop loss \u20b9 422 The stock has witnessed a decent pullback with currently indicating a breakout with a bullish candle formation above the previous peak zone of 414 levels to anticipate for further rise in the coming sessions. The RSI is on the rise with much upside potential visible from current rate and can carry on with the positive move further ahead. We suggest to buy the stock for an initial target of 455 keeping the stop loss of 422 level.\n\n4] UCO Bank: Buy at \u20b9 56.55, target \u20b9 60, stop loss \u20b9 55 The stock after a short span of consolidation has indicated a big bullish candle formation on the daily chart moving past the important 50EMA level of 53.75 zone to improve the bias and can expect for further rise. The RSI currently is well placed showing strength and has signalled a buy with potential to carry on with the positive move further ahead. We suggest to buy the stock for an initial upside target of 60 keeping the stop loss of 55.\n\n5] Madras Fertilizers Ltd: Buy at \u20b9 91.40, target \u20b9 96, stop loss \u20b9 89 The stock after indicating a higher low formation on the daily chart has picked up well to move past the 50EMA level at 90.20 zone to strengthen the trend and with a positive candle formation, we anticipate further upward movement in the coming sessions. The RSI currently is well placed and on the rise with much upside potential visible from current rate. With the chart looking attractive, we suggest to buy the stock for an initial target of 96 keeping the stop loss of 89.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to India VIX, eight stocks to buy or sell on Tuesday \u2014 May 21\nStock market today: The domestic benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, are probably going to open higher on Tuesday's trading session, amidst mixed global cues.\n\nThe Indian benchmark indices is off to a solid start, based on Gift Nifty's trends. The Gift Nifty was trading at a premium of around 70 points from the previous closing of the Nifty futures, at 22,610.\n\nThe benchmark Nifty 50 closed the special trading session on Saturday over the 22,500 mark, while the domestic market indices finished with modest gains.\n\nThe Nifty 50 closed 35.90 points, or 0.16%, higher at 22,502.00, while the Sensex increased 88.91 points, or 0.12%, to conclude at 74,005.94.\n\nDue to the Lok Sabha elections in Mumbai on Monday, the Indian stock market was closed.\n\nTrade setup for Tuesday The Nifty 50 is still in the channel and closed over 22,500 for the first time in a few days, according to Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities. On the daily chart, a small-bodied candle, however, offers very little information about the direction the price will go in the future. Furthermore, there is noticeable inflection around the 22,500 strike, as seen by the thick writing in both the call and put. To confirm any directional shift, traders must thus exercise caution throughout the first hour of trading. At 22,400, support is evident. On the plus side, a strong advance might push the index in the near future towards 22,600 and beyond.\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Anand Rathi's Ganesh Dongre, Prabhudas Lilladher's Shiju Koothupalakkal, and Choice Broking's Sumeet Bagadia have suggested a total of eight buy or sell stocks for today. These stocks are arranged and explained further under the names of the experts.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager - Technical Research at Anand Rathi\n\n1. Tata Motors: Buy at \u20b9954, target \u20b9985, stop loss \u20b9930\n\nWe have seen major support in this stock around \u20b9930. So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen a reversal price action formation at the 954 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of \u20b9985. So traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b9930 for the target price of \u20b9985 in the upcoming weeks.\n\n2. Indian Energy Exchange: Buy at \u20b9159, target \u20b9172, stop loss \u20b9152\n\nIn the short-term trend, the stock has seen a bullish reversal pattern; technically, retrenchment could be possible till \u20b9172. So, holding the support level of \u20b9152, this stock can bounce toward the level of \u20b9172 in the short term, so the trader can go along with a stop loss of \u20b9151 for the target price of \u20b9172.\n\n3. Vedanta: Buy at \u20b9462, target \u20b9482, stop loss \u20b9450\n\nWe have seen strong support in this stock around \u20b9482. So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen a reversal price action and bullish candlestick pattern formation at the 462 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of \u20b9482, so traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b9450 for the target price of \u20b9482 in the upcoming weeks.\n\nShiju Koothupalakkal's buy or sell stocks 4. West Coast Paper Mills: Buy at \u20b9651.40, target \u20b9680, stop loss \u20b9637\n\nThe stock, after witnessing the short correction, has taken support near the 612 zone and indicated a pullback to form a higher low pattern on the daily chart, breaching above the 50EMA level of 640 to improve the bias. We can expect further rises in the coming sessions. The RSI is well placed, signalling a buy, and with upside potential visible from the current rate, we suggest buying the stock for an initial target of 680, keeping the stop loss at 637.\n\n5. Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore: Buy at \u20b9696.30, target \u20b9730, stop loss \u20b9682\n\nThe stock has recently moved past the important 200 period MA and has also breached above the significant 50EMA level of 693 to improve the bias and is anticipated to further rise in the coming sessions. The RSI currently well placed, showing strength, and has signalled a buy with the potential to carry on with the positive move further ahead. We suggest buying the stock for an initial upside target of 730 while keeping the stop loss of 682.\n\n6. Royal Orchid Hotels: Buy at \u20b9379.60, target \u20b9400, stop loss \u20b9381\n\nThe stock, after the decent correction, has bottomed out near the 360 zone and indicated a decent pullback to improve the bias, anticipating further rises in the coming sessions. The RSI is currently well placed and improved, with a trend reversal confirmed to signal a buy and much upside potential visible from the current rate. With the chart looking attractive, we suggest buying the stock for an initial target of 400 while keeping the stop loss of 381.\n\nSumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking 7. Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy: Buy at \u20b9820.65, target \u20b9865, stop loss \u20b9791\n\nSterling and Wilson Renewable Energy, which is presently trading at an all-time high of 823 levels, is displaying significant bullish momentum. Strong trading volumes have backed the recent breakout above the critical resistance at 755 levels, which is an important technical development that highlights the strength of the stock. The discovery raises the possibility that the upward trend would continue, providing investors with a positive outlook.\n\nTo further support its bullish outlook, Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy is also trading above important moving averages, such as the short-term (20 Day), medium-term (50 Day), and long-term (200 Day) EMAs. Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator, is currently at 76.33 points.\n\nIt is advisable for traders to monitor the strong support level around 791 levels, as a breach of this level may indicate a change in market attitude. Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy present technical configuration overall shows a favourable atmosphere for potential upside growth going forward, so long as traders and investors keep a careful eye on important support and resistance levels and are alert to any possible reversals.\n\nWe advise purchasing Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy at the CMP of \u20b9820.65 and a stop loss of \u20b9791 in order to reach the target of \u20b9865, based on the analysis above.\n\n8. Tide Water Oil: Buy at \u20b91936.2, target \u20b92,050, stop loss \u20b91,866\n\nTide Water Oil Ltd is currently trading at \u20b91,936.2. After a period of small falls and sideways consolidation, the stock has lately broken the neckline levels of \u20b91,870 and is rising quickly on the upside with substantial volume. There are expectations of further upward movement, potentially reaching \u20b92,050 levels. On the downside, substantial support is evident near \u20b91,866.\n\nFurthermore, Tide Water Oil Ltd is trading above key Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), including the 20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day EMAs. This suggests a strong bullish momentum, indicating the potential for continued upward price action. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 74.23, signalling an upward trajectory and confirming an increase in buying momentum.\n\nIn summary, considering the technical analysis and prevailing market conditions, Tide Water Oil appears to present a promising buying opportunity for those targeting a \u20b92,050 price objective, contingent upon the implementation of prudent risk management measures.\n\nTo manage risk effectively, it is advisable to set a stop-loss (SL) at \u20b91,866 to protect the investment in case of an unexpected market reversal.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to India VIX, three stocks to buy or sell on Saturday - May 18\nStock market today: Today the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) will hold a special live trading session. During this session, there will be an intraday shift in the Equity and Equity Derivatives Segments from the Primary Site (PR) to the Disaster Recovery Site (DR). This special live trading session, which serves as a demonstration for their thorough preparation, will be divided into two separate parts. The first session is planned to begin at 9:15 IST and end at 10:00 IST, while the second session will run from 11:30 IST to 12:30 IST.\n\nFriday's session saw gains in the domestic equity benchmark indices, the Sensex and Nifty 50, for the second day in a row due to purchases in Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), Reliance Industries, and ITC.\n\nThe Nifty 50 regained the crucial 22,400 mark during the last hour, which caused the bears to evacuate. With a daily decrease of 1.38%, the India VIX also ended below the 20-point threshold at 19.99.\n\nThe 30-share BSE Sensex completed Friday's session higher, up 253.31 points, or 0.34%, at the 73,917.03 level, while the Nifty 50 closed up 62.25 points, or 0.28%, at 22,466.10 level.\n\nThe Nifty Midcap 50 Index finished 0.94% higher while the Nifty Smallcap Index ended 0.84% higher.\n\nThe Indian market saw a strong comeback, according to Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, amid conflicting global cues and uncertainty surrounding the US Federal Reserve. This recovery was primarily driven by the market's outperformance and strong Q4 results.\n\n\u201cFurther, some index heavyweight earnings surpassed expectations, and midcap and small-cap stocks continued to exhibit buying interest during dips. Auto and consumer durables particularly stood out with strong earnings,\u201d added Nair.\n\nTrade setup for Saturday Nifty 50 Outlook Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst Kunal Shah of LKP Securities claims that although the Nifty 50 index maintained its momentum, it was unable to cross the 22,500 barrier, which is the point at which the call side is building the greatest amount of open interest. The index must firmly breach this level in order to reach its all-time high level in the near future. The 22,300 level serves as the downside support, and drops towards this level are a great time to start long bets.4o.\n\nBank Nifty Outlook Tejas Shah, Technical Research, JM Financial & BlinkX, explains that this week's Bank Nifty underperformed in comparison to the Nifty 50. It closed around the 48,000 to 48,100 (+/- 50 point) barrier zone once more, and he thinks that the Bank Nifty can only continue to outperform if it can close above this resistance zone decisively; otherwise, profit booking is likely to continue. In terms of the downside, 48,150 / 48,500 represents resistance, while the support zone is located around 47,500-600 / 46,900-47,000.\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager - Technical Research at Anand Rathi BUY Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd at \u20b9 1,698 with a stoploss of \u20b9 1,665 and a target of \u20b9 1,740. Dongre said that they have seen major support in this stock around \u20b91,665. So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen a reversal price action formation at the 1,698 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of \u20b91,740. So traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b91,665 for the target price of \u20b91,740 in the upcoming weeks.\n\nBUY ITC Ltd at \u20b9 436 with a stoploss of \u20b9 428 and a target of \u20b9 448. In the short-term trend, the stock has seen a bullish reversal pattern; technically, retrenchment could be possible till 448. So, holding the support level of 428, this stock can bounce toward the level of 448 in the short term, so the trader can go along with a stop loss of 428 for the target price of 448, advised Ganesh.\n\nBUY Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL)at \u20b9 2,870 with a stoploss of \u20b9 2,840 and a target of \u20b9 2,920. We have seen a strong support in this stock around 2,840 rupees. So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen a reversal price action and bullish candlestick pattern formation at the 2,870 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of \u20b92,920, so traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of 2,840 for the target price of \u20b92,920 in the upcoming weeks, said Dongre.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to India VIX, eight stocks to buy or sell on Friday \u2014 May 17\nStock market today: The Indian stock market closed higher on Thursday, with the Nifty 50 index gaining 203 points and the BSE Sensex surging 676 points. The Bank Nifty index also ended on a high note, up by 289 points. Cash market volumes on the NSE reached \u20b91.17 lakh crore, the highest since May 03. The small-cap index outperformed the frontline indices, and the advance-decline ratio remained positive at 1.32:1.\n\nTrade setup for Friday On the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, a seasoned Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, shares his insights. He says, \"The formation of long lower shadows for two occasions in the last four sessions signals emergence of sharp buying on dips. This is a positive indication and suggests more upside ahead. Immediate resistance of 22,300 (mid part of the long bear weekly candle of last week) has been taken out on the upside on Thursday, and the Nifty is expected to reach another resistance of around 22600 levels (upper part of the last weekly candle) in the near term. Immediate support for Nifty today is placed at 22,280 levels.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Neeraj Sharma, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"The Bank Nifty opened higher but remained volatile throughout the day, ultimately closing higher at 47,977. Technically, the index still respects a bullish engulfing candle, indicating strength. The bullish momentum will continue as long as the index remains above 46,980. On the upside, the 21-DEMA is placed near 48,050, which will serve as the first hurdle for the index, followed by 48,500.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Indian stock market, Sumeet Bagadia, an experienced Executive Director at Choice Broking, provides his analysis. He says, \"The India VIX Index has retraced from the 52-week high, but the volatility index is still in the 19 to 22 range. Bragging below 19 would inject more confidence among bulls. However, breaching the upper hurdle would mean fresh volatility in the Indian stock market.\"\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Stock recommendations for today: Sumeet Bagadia of Choice Broking, Ganesh Dongre of Anand Rathi, and Shiju Koothupalakkal of Prabhudas Lilladher have recommended a total of eight buy or sell stocks for today. These stocks are categorized under each expert's name for better organization and understanding.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Welspun Enterprises: Buy at \u20b9392.75, target \u20b9415, stop loss \u20b9377.\n\nWelspun Enterprises share has recently exhibited a robust breakout from the critical resistance zone of \u20b9365 to \u20b9377 daily, consolidating the move with higher highs and higher lows on the weekly chart.

The recent breakout above the crucial resistance at \u20b9585 levels is a significant technical development supported by robust trading volumes, reinforcing the strength of the stock. The breakthrough suggests a potential continuation of the upward trend, offering an optimistic outlook for investors with a target of \u20b9644 and a stop loss at \u20b9584.\n\nGanesh Dongre's shares to buy today 3] Chambal Fertilizers: Buy at \u20b9404, target \u20b9422, stop loss \u20b9392.\n\nWe have seen significant support in this stock, around \u20b9392. So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen a reversal price action formation at the \u20b9404 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of \u20b9422. So, traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b9392 for the target price of \u20b9422 in the near term.\n\n4] ICICI Prudential: Buy at \u20b9590, target \u20b9615, stop loss \u20b9575.\n\nIn the short term, the stock has seen a bullish reversal pattern. Technically, retrenchment could be possible until \u20b9612. So, holding the support level of \u20b9575, this stock can bounce toward \u20b9615 in the short term, so the trader can go along with a stop loss of \u20b9575 for the target price of \u20b9615.\n\n5] Power Grid Corporation: Buy at \u20b9312, target \u20b9328, stop loss \u20b9304.\n\nWe have seen strong support in this stock, around 304 rupees. So, at the current juncture, the stock has again seen reversal price action and bullish candlestick pattern formation at the \u20b9312 price level, which may continue its rally until its next resistance level of \u20b9328. Hence, traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b9304 for the target price of \u20b9328 in the near term.\n\nShiju Koothupalakkal's buy or sell stocks 6] Chalet Hotels: Buy at \u20b9789, target \u20b9824, stop loss \u20b9767.\n\nAfter witnessing the short correction, the stock has taken support near the \u20b941 zone and indicated a pullback to improve the bias. We can expect a further rise in the coming sessions. The RSI is well placed, cooling off from near the overbought zone. With upside potential visible from the current rate, we suggest buying the stock for an initial target of \u20b9724, keeping the stop loss at the \u20b9767 level.\n\n7] HCC: Buy at \u20b936.55, target \u20b939, stop loss \u20b935.\n\nThe stock recently witnessed a decent pullback to move past the 50EMA level of \u20b936 to improve the bias and is anticipated to rise further in the coming sessions. The RSI is currently well placed, showing strength, and has signalled a buy with the potential to carry on with the positive move further ahead. We suggest buying the stock for an initial upside target of \u20b939, keeping the stop loss of \u20b935.\n\n8] LIC Housing Finance: Buy at \u20b9653, target \u20b9682, stop loss \u20b9638.\n\nAfter the consolidation, the stock has indicated a positive candle formation, moving past the 50EMA level of \u20b9633 to improve the bias and has scope for further rise in the coming sessions. The RSI has consolidated and indicated a trend reversal to signal a buy with upside potential visible from the current rate. With the chart looking attractive, we suggest buying the stock for an initial target of \u20b9682, keeping the stop loss of \u20b9638.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to India VIX, five stocks to buy or sell on Friday \u2014 May 10\nStock market today: Following weak global sentiments, the Indian stock market ended lower for the fifth straight session on Thursday. The Nifty 50 index crashed 345 points and closed below the 22,000 mark at 21,957. The BSE Sensex tanked 1062 points and finished at 72,404, while the Bank Nifty index, which tracks the performance of the banking sector, nosedived 533 points and ended at a 47,487 level. Cash market volumes on the NSE, which indicate the liquidity in the market, rose to \u20b91.02 lakh crore. However, the broad market indices, which provide a more comprehensive view of the market, fell more than the Nifty 50 index even as the advance-decline ratio, which measures the number of advancing stocks to declining stocks, fell sharply to 0.17:1 (lowest since March 13, 2024).\n\nTrade setup for Friday On the outlook for the Nifty 50 index, Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager \u2014 Technical Research at Anand Rathi, said, \"On the Nifty front, the 50-stock index closed near the support level of 21800\u201321900 zone. If Nifty holds this support level, then upward movement can be seen for the frontline index in the upcoming days. Now the next resistance for the Nifty spot will be 22500-22600. On Thursday, we saw the gap down opening, and the index witnessed profit booking for the rest of the day. So, on the Nifty front, currently, Nifty is in an oversold zone. Hence, we may see short covering in upcoming trading sessions; the next nifty support stands at the 21800-21900 level.\"\n\n\"On the Bank Nifty front, we have seen profit booking today; Bank Nifty is also in the oversold zone. So upcoming Bank Nifty resistance stands at 48,500 and support at 47,500 level,\" said Dongre.\n\nOn the outlook for the Indian stock market, Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, said, \"The India VIX today is in the 17 to 19 range. We saw the India VIX Index breaching above the 19 mark when it climbed to a new 52-week high of 19.17. However, it failed to sustain at the higher levels and retraced after some time. A decisive breach above 19 would trigger a fresh and strong upside in India's volatility index, and we can expect the index to touch 22 in the short term.\"\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts When asked about stocks to buy today, Sumeet Bagadia and Ganesh Dongre, renowned experts in the field, recommended five buy or sell stocks for today \u2014 Infosys, ITC, Aegis Logistics, TVS Motor, and Sun TV. Their recommendations are based on thorough analysis and market trends.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Infosys: Buy at \u20b91439.50, target \u20b91512, stop loss \u20b91400.\n\nInfosys share is currently valued at \u20b91439.50. Recent market trends, including a reversal from the bottom indicated by a neutral candlestick pattern at the bottom, suggest a bullish reversal accompanied by robust trading volume. These patterns indicate a potential solid upward trajectory in the stock, providing a secure investment option.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) presently stands at 43.3 and is trending upwards, suggesting a significant surge in buying momentum. RSI and Stochastic RSI are in the overbought region, indicating that positional traders may consider holding their positions and implementing a trailing stop-loss.\n\n2] Sun TV: Buy at \u20b9656.80, target \u20b9704, stop loss \u20b9629.\n\nSun TV share price has recently experienced a robust rebound from a formidable support level at \u20b9629, near its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Trading above key moving averages, including the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs, further strengthens its bullish outlook. Sun TV share price currently faces a minor resistance around \u20b9670 levels. Upon breaching this resistance, SUNTV is poised for a significant upward movement towards the target of \u20b9704.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 3] ITC: Buy at \u20b9429, target \u20b9440, stop loss \u20b9418.\n\nWe have seen significant support in this stock at around \u20b9418. So, at the current juncture, ITC share price has again seen a reversal price action formation at the \u20b9429 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of \u20b9440. Hence, traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b9418 for the target price of \u20b9440 \u20b9in the near term.\n\n4] Aegis Logistics: Buy at \u20b9580, target \u20b9630, stop loss \u20b9560.\n\nIn the short-term trend, Aegis Logistics' share price has seen a bullish reversal pattern; technically, the reduction could be possible till \u20b9630. So, holding the support level of \u20b9560, Aegis Logistics share price can bounce toward \u20b9630 in the short term. Hence, traders can go along with a stop loss of \u20b9560 for the target price of \u20b9630.\n\n5] TVS Motor: Buy at \u20b92065, target \u20b92150, stop loss \u20b92010.\n\nWe have seen strong support in this stock around 2010 rupees. So, at the current juncture, TVS Motor share has again seen a reversal price action and bullish candlestick pattern formation at the \u20b92065 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of \u20b92150. Hence, traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b92010 for the target price of \u20b92150 in the near term.",

The advance-decline ratio rose to 1.36:1.\n\nTrade setup for Thursday On the outlook for Nifty today, Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager \u2014 Technical Research at Anand Rathi, said, \"On the Nifty front, the 50-stock index closed near the support level of 22100\u201322200 zone. If the frontline index holds this support level, upward movement can be seen in the upcoming days. Now, the next resistance for the Nifty 50 index is placed at 22500-22600. As per Wednesday's chart pattern, we have seen the gap down opening and the whole day, Nifty, remain in a choppy trend. After this, indices closed in negative territory at the end of the day. So, on the Nifty front, the 50-stock index is in an oversold zone. Hence, we may see short covering in upcoming trading sessions. The next Nifty support stands at 22100-22200 level.\"\n\n\"On the Bank Nifty front, we have seen profit booking today. Bank Nifty resistance stands at 49,000, and support is at the 47,500 level,\" the Anand Rathi expert added.\n\nSpeaking on the outlook for the India VIX today, Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, said, \"The India VIX Index has made a strong base around the 17 mark. The volatility index may touch the 14 to 12 mark on breaching below this support. However, the index is facing a hurdle at 19, and upon breaching this resistance, it may reach the 22 mark in the very short term.\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Regarding stocks to buy today, both the experts recommended five buy or sell stocks for today \u2014 SBI, ABB India, BEL, and Dr Lal Pathlabs.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] ABB India: Buy at \u20b97186.75, target \u20b97666, stop loss \u20b96955.\n\nABB India's share price is exhibiting bullish solid momentum, currently trading at an all-time high of \u20b97218. The recent breakout above the crucial resistance at \u20b96800 levels is a significant technical development supported by robust trading volumes, reinforcing the strength of the stock. The breakthrough suggests a potential continuation of the upward trend, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.\n\n2] SBI: Buy at \u20b9811, target \u20b9850, stop loss \u20b9792.\n\nSBI share price is currently at a crucial juncture in its trading dynamics. The stock stands resilient with a robust support base at \u20b9792 levels, near its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Trading at approximately \u20b9810.80 levels, the SBI share price exhibits strength by maintaining levels above key moving averages.\n\nGanesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks 3] Dr Lal Pathlabs: Buy at \u20b92325, target \u20b92450, stop loss \u20b92250.\n\nDr Lal Pathlabs share price has seen a bullish reversal pattern, technically reduction could be possible till \u20b92450. So, holding the support level of \u20b92250, Dr Lal Pathlabs share price can bounce toward \u20b92450 in the short term. Hence, the trader can go along with a stop loss of \u20b92250 for the target price of \u20b92450.\n\n4] BEL: Buy at \u20b9230, target \u20b9240, stop loss \u20b9220.\n\nWe have seen strong support in BEL share price around \u20b9225. So, at the current juncture, BEL share price has again seen a reversal price action and bullish candlestick pattern formation at the \u20b9230 price level, which may continue its rally till its next resistance level of \u20b9240. Hence, traders can buy and hold this stock with a stop loss of \u20b9220 for the target price of \u20b9240 in the near term.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to India VIX, four stocks to buy or sell on Wednesday \u2014 May 8\nStock market today: After showing a sideways movement (a term used to describe a market that is neither trending up nor down) with a weak bias (a slight inclination towards a particular direction) on Monday, the Indian stock market slipped into the weakness zone (a period of declining prices) with range-bound action (a situation where the price of a security trades in a narrow band) and ended lower on Tuesday. The Nifty 50 index dipped 140 points and closed at the 22,302 mark, the BSE Sensex corrected 383 points and closed at the 73,511 level, while the Bank Nifty index lost 609 points and finished at the 48,285 mark.\n\nIndia VIX index ended 2.45 percent higher at 17.01 after hitting a new 52-week peak of 17.64 mark, logging over 35 percent rise on one week. Declining shares outnumbered the advancing shares as the advance-decline ratio stood at 0.40 on BSE, the lowest since 15th April 2024. All the sectoral Indices are closed in red (a term used to indicate a negative performance) except Nifty FMCG and Nifty IT. Nifty Reality, Metal, and PSU Banks fell the most among them.\n\nTrade setup for Wednesday On the outlook for the Nifty 50 today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The lower tops and bottoms on the daily chart are intact, and the present weakness could be in line with the new higher bottom formation of the pattern. The higher bottom reversal must be confirmed with an upside bounce from the lows. Immediate resistance for the Nifty 50 index is placed at 22,400 levels; the next lower levels will be watched around 22,100 to 22,000.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said, \"On the hourly chart, a head and shoulders pattern has emerged, with the index already breaking below the neckline. More weakness is anticipated in the coming days, potentially pushing the index towards 47700. Resistance is observed at 48800 on the higher end.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Indian stock market today, Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta, said, \"Domestic benchmark indices opened higher on Tuesday, aided by favourable global clues. However, after some initial jitters, the market saw massive profit bookings, with the Volatility Index (India VIX) jumping by about 6%. Later in the day, volatility decreased, and the index closed at 22,302. Technically, the index created a bearish engulfing candle last week, indicating weakness. The index settled below the low of the bearish engulfing candle and the 34-Day Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) support, suggesting further pessimism.\"\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Stock market experts Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Virat Jagad, Technical Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio, have shared their insights for Wednesday's trading. Bagadia recommends buying Supreme Industries and Siemens, while Jagad suggests considering Westlife Foodworld and CG Power & Industrial Solutions.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Supreme Industries: This stock is a potential winner. Buy at \u20b95247.35, with a target of \u20b95555, and a stop loss at \u20b95050. This could be a profitable move for you.\n\nSupreme Industries share has recently experienced a significant breakthrough above the crucial resistance zone, ranging from \u20b95000 to \u20b95150 on the daily chart. This breakout has been accompanied by a consolidation of the upward movement, characterized by higher highs and higher lows. A noticeable surge in trading volume further validates the strong bullish sentiment.\n\n2] Siemens: Buy at \u20b96094.60, target \u20b96444, stop loss \u20b95900.\n\nSiemens share price daily chart analysis offers a favourable view for the following week, indicating a steady higher advance. Notably, the stock has produced a notable higher high and higher low pattern, and the company's recent upward swing has effectively violated the neckline, establishing a new week high. This breakthrough indicates the possibility of a significant follow-through upward increase in the stock price.\n\nVirat Jagad's buy or sell stocks 3] Westlife Foodworld: Buy at \u20b9880 to \u20b9885, target \u20b9940, stop loss \u20b9860.\n\nWestlife Foodworld Ltd: Our analysts have conducted a thorough analysis of this stock. They have identified a potential uptrend on its daily chart, resembling a rounding bottom pattern. This indicates a shift from a downtrend to a possible uptrend. A bullish candlestick formation further confirms positive market sentiment. The stock is currently trading above both the Fast (21) and Slow (50) Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), suggesting strong upward momentum. The trading volume has increased on buying days, indicating heightened interest from buyers. Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending higher, signalling a bullish market trend. All these factors point towards a positive outlook for Westlife Foodworld Ltd.\n\n4] CG Power & Industrial Solutions: Buy at \u20b9570 to \u20b9572, target \u20b9610, stop loss \u20b9550.\n\nCG Power & Industrial Solutions Ltd has demonstrated a consistent northward trajectory, characterized by a pattern of higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart. Volume increase during the buying day indicates buyers are active in the stock. Furthermore, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is noteworthy for surpassing the 70-level threshold, underscoring the prevailing bullish momentum. The price has closed near the high, forming a bullish candle. Prices are trading above the Fast (21) EMA and Slow (50) EMA, indicating a positive trend. On the Directional front, DI+ is trading above DI- indicating a positive trend, and ADX trading above DI indicates strength in the move. These technical indicators collectively support the notion of a bullish trajectory for CG Power & Industrial Solutions Ltd.",

However, the broad market indices fell more than the frontline indices even as the advance-decline ratio fell sharply to 0.45:1.\n\nTrade setup for Tuesday On the outlook for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The short-term trend of Nifty remains negative as long as the support of 22300 holds, an upside in the market is possible. A move below the support could open more weakness in the short term.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities, said, \"The BankNifty index underwent a sideways trading session, with bulls successfully defending the support zone around 49000-48900. Immediate resistance is noted at 49300, and a decisive breakthrough could trigger short-covering moves towards 49500. Conversely, a significant breach of the 48900 mark may induce further selling pressure towards 48400, where the 20DMA is positioned.\"\n\nVaishali Parekh, Vice President \u2014 Technical Research at Prabhudas Lilladher, believes immediate support for Sensex/Nifty today is placed at 73400/22300, while the resistance is at 74300/22600.

A recent formation of a Cup & Handle pattern on the daily chart, coupled with robust trading volume, indicates a strong upward trajectory in the stock. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) presently stands at 63.4 and is trending upwards, suggesting a significant surge in buying momentum. RSI and Stochastic RSI are in the overbought region, indicating that positional traders may consider holding their positions and implementing a trailing stop-loss.\n\n2] Brigade Enterprises: Buy at \u20b91110, target \u20b91166, stop loss \u20b91077.\n\nBrigade Enterprises share is currently trading at \u20b91110.05. After minor falls and sideways consolidation, the stock has lately broken the neckline levels of \u20b91077 and is rising quickly on the upside with substantial volume. There are expectations of further upward movement, potentially reaching \u20b91166 levels. On the downside, considerable support is evident at nearly \u20b91077.\n\nFurthermore, Brigade Enterprises shares are trading above crucial Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), including 20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day EMAs. This suggests a strong bullish momentum, indicating the potential for continued upward price action. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 69.92, signalling an upward trajectory and confirming an increase in buying momentum.\n\nGanesh Dongre's stock of the day 3] Coal India: Buy at CMP, target \u20b9490, stop loss \u20b9430.\n\nCoal India shares have made an immediate base at \u20b9430, which may soon touch \u20b9485 to \u20b9490.\n\nDrumil Vithlani's buy or sell stock 4] Jubilant Food: Buy at \u20b9473 to \u20b9474, target \u20b9485, stop loss \u20b9467.\n\nJubilant Food share is seen to break out of the Rectangle pattern on the daily time frame and make a bullish candlestick, which is why a buy recommendation is initiated for targets up to \u20b9485. One can initiate buy-on dip in the range of \u20b9472 to \u20b9473 with stop loss below \u20b9466 on a daily closing basis.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 to Sensex, five stocks to buy or sell on Monday \u2014 May 6\nStock market today: Despite strong global market sentiments, the Indian stock market ended lower on Friday. The Nifty 50 index ended 172 points lower after reaching a new peak of 22,794, and the BSE Sensex dropped 732 points from its lifetime high of 75,124. The Bank Nifty index also saw a significant decline of 307 points, closing at 48,923. In the broader market, the small-cap index finished 0.55 per cent lower after reaching a new peak of 47,678, and the mid-cap index ended 0.21 per cent lower after touching a new high of 42,774.\n\nTrade setup for Monday On the outlook for the Nifty 50 today, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said, \"The short-term trend of the Nifty 50 index seems to have reversed. The higher top of the bullish pattern will likely be completed on Friday at the swing high of 22,794 levels, and a short-term downward correction is expected in the coming sessions. Immediate resistance for Nifty today is placed at 22,600, and the following downside levels are to be watched around 22,120 levels.\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities, said, \"The BankNifty index faced selling pressure from higher levels but maintained its uptrend, closing near the immediate support of 49,000. Immediate resistance is at 49,200, and a break above could trigger short-covering moves towards 49,500 levels. Conversely, immediate support lies at 48,800-48,700, and a breach might lead to further downside towards the 48,400 mark, where the 20DMA is situated.\"\n\nUnveiling intraday trading strategy and factors that may dominate the Indian stock market today, Aditya Gaggar, Director of Progressive Shares, said, \"A strong outperformance can be expected from the Pharma sector once it gives a consolidation breakout. Extreme volatility can be anticipated due to result-oriented activities and the progress of the general election.\"\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts Regarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts \u2014 Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking, and Shiju Koothupalakkal, Technical Research Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher \u2014 recommended five buy or sell stocks today.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Zomato: Buy at \u20b9197.25, target \u20b9208, stop loss \u20b9191.\n\nZomato share price is currently trading at \u20b9197.25. The stock has consistently found support around the \u20b9192 level, establishing it as a reliable support zone. The anticipated trading range for the stock is expected to be between \u20b9180 and \u20b9199, with the possibility of sideways movement within this range. A decisive close above the \u20b9200 level could propel the stock towards the \u20b9208 level in the coming days.\n\n2] Polycab: Buy at \u20b95832, target \u20b96099, stop loss \u20b95699.\n\nPolycab share price daily chart analysis offers a favourable view for the following week, indicating a steady higher advance. Notably, the stock has produced a notable higher high and higher low pattern, and the company's recent upward swing has effectively violated the neckline, establishing a new week high. This breakthrough indicates the possibility of a significant follow-through upward increase in the stock price.\n\nShiju Koothupalakkal's shares to buy today 3] HBL Power: Buy at \u20b9555.60, target \u20b9580, stop loss \u20b9544.\n\nHBL Power shares witnessed a steady gain from the \u20b9436 zone to move past the confluence of 50EMA and 100 periods MA at the \u20b9474 zone, improving the bias and recently breaching above the resistance zone of \u20b9536 levels has further strengthened the trend. With the rising RSI and further rise anticipated, we suggest buying the stock for an initial target of \u20b9580 while keeping the stop loss at \u20b9544.\n\n4] Jindal Saw: Buy at \u20b9575, target \u20b9607, stop loss \u20b9562.\n\nThe stock has gained strength after indicating a breakout above the previous peak and resistance zone of \u20b9550, anticipating further rise in the coming sessions. The RSI has indicated upside potential visible from current levels, and with a positive candle formation on the daily chart to signify an improvement in bias, we suggest buying the stock for an initial target of \u20b9607, keeping the stop loss of \u20b9562 level.\n\n5] NMDC: Buy at \u20b9269, target \u20b9285, stop loss \u20b9262.\n\nNMDC share price has maintained a strong uptrend, indicating that a bullish candle formation to move out of the consolidation period has entered fresh territory with anticipation of further rise in the coming sessions. With the chart looking good, we suggest buying the stock for an initial target of \u20b9285 while keeping the stop loss at \u20b9262.",

        "text": "Stock market today: Trade setup for Nifty 50 after US Fed meeting, seven stocks to buy or sell on Thursday \u2014 May 2\nStock market today: Following strong global market sentiments after the US Fed chair downplayed the rate hike buzz in the US Fed meeting on Wednesday, the Indian stock market is expected to react to this overnight trigger. This US Fed news is expected to offer some relief to the global markets including Asian and the Indian stock markets today. On Wednesday, US dollar rates came under profit-booking pressure and the US dollar index came below the psychological 106 level. This triggered buying in the US stock markets. Dow Jones index finished 0.23 percent higher on Wednesday whereas the Smallcap 2000 index finished 0.12 percent higher. However, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended in the red zone.\n\nUS Fed meeting outcome in focus Speaking on how the US Fed meeting outcome would impact the Indian stock market, Sugandha Sachdeva, Founder at SS WealthStreet said, \"In the US Fed meeting yesterday, Fed chair Jerome Powell hinted a willingness to cut interest rates despite sticky inflation, it may initially boost stock prices. Lower interest rates tend to be positive for stocks as they can stimulate economic activity and corporate profits.\" She said that Jerome Powell's dovish stance on the US Fed rate has weakened the US dollar and the trend is expected to continue in the near term.\n\nTrade setup for Thursday Speaking on the outlook for the Nifty 50 today, Neeraj Sharma, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C Mehta said, \"Domestic benchmark indices opened higher on Tuesday, driven by positive global cues. Due to strong buying interest, the Nifty registered a fresh all-time high of 22,783.35. But following that, there was a significant amount of profit booking, and the index ended the day lower at 22,605. Moreover, the Volatility Index, India VIX, surged by 5.19% ahead of the US Federal meeting on interest rates. From a technical standpoint, the index on a daily scale has formed a bearish candle near the previous high. Thus, 22,780-22,800 will act as a strong hurdle for the index in the short term. As long as the index remains below 22,800, a short-term retracement towards 22,500-22,300 could be possible. If the index sustains above 22,800, then the rally could stretch towards 23,000-23,100 levels. For the short term, 22,500 and 22,300 will act as strong support levels, whereas 22,800 and 23,000 will act as barriers for the index.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said, \"Bank Nifty has managed to hold on to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level 47440 and witnessed a pullback during the last hour of trade. We expect the pullback to continue till 48000 \u2013 48200 over the next few trading sessions. The crucial support level is placed at 47300.\"\n\nBuy or sell stock ideas by experts On stocks to buy today, stock market experts \u2014 Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking; Shiju Koothupalakkal, Technical Research Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher; and Mitesh Karwa, Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio \u2014 recommended six buy or sell stocks for today.\n\nSumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy today 1] Voltas: Buy at \u20b91475, target \u20b91555, stop loss \u20b91433.\n\nVoltas share price daily chart analysis offers a favourable view for the following week, indicating a steady higher advance.
