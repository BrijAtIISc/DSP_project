So, we do not necessarily have to wear the crown of being the best performing on the way down as well. That said, the major issue remains that we are in a synchronised global market and I do not think that we will step way out of line and given what the Indian government is doing which is to make ourselves more and more pre 1991 in terms of its protectionism, I would think that if we actually go down that road, then one could argue that there may be a difference but then it will be at a much lower level than where we are right now.Even the other ones were clearly focused on the domestic market. One cannot argue that consumption related stocks are anything to do with other than the Indian market but you are right. Now obviously the focus seems to have moved to a little more industrial activity rather than the consumer activity. So far, FMCG and banking essentially were consumer led because you were not talking about corporate banking at all. Now, there is some chance that you are looking at a revival of some kind in the economy especially at the industrial level and therefore the likes of M&HCV, etc, have started move and it is possible that that may translate into better activity in the industrial space.Clearly infrastructure related areas continue to remain interesting because of the government spend. What we are also looking at if you look at the earnings growth this year, you are looking at actually the corporate facing banks supposedly showing better earnings is at least what the analysts are forecasting. So, you have to look at those areas now and hope that that is where you will make you next level of earnings from.As I just mentioned I think the most analysts are now factoring in the fact that much of the earnings growth this year in the financials will come through from public sector banks. BOB has only one issue that the leadership is up for retirement and unless they get an extension there will be a problem but one assumes that the government did not put up a new leadership only for three years. So if that extension comes through, the numbers are looking quite interesting because if you assume that the provisions have been made largely, you are looking at almost a 14-15% ROE next year and the stock is trading at just over one time book value.Clearly that will mean that there is significant upside that can be possible in a stock like BOB. The SBI numbers are a little more disappointing because clearly the RBI divergence is not something that I like very much. Eventually, if the economy were to revive, then SBI cannot be left far behind but between the two, my vote would go to BOB if we have to make a choice.So long as the protection continues to remain for the Indian steel manufacturers, they are mandated to make money. The only thing they can do is something stupid like going and buying very aggressively one of the companies which is being put up by the banks for sale. If Tata Steel does it, yet again which they have done in the past and over pays for something like Essar Steel for example. That can be a dampener but otherwise on pure performance, with the kind of protection that the government has given them, it will be difficult for them to screw up.Well, yes. I think you know as I said the CV cycle is the one that seems to be the most robust among the auto sector and Chola is clearly leveraged very well to that and executing extremely well. I think there is a good chance that Chola will continue to outperform. Their execution has been very good. There is no particular reason to assume that they will flounder from here. Valuations are a little stretched but no more than any of the other NBFCs. If you have to be in the NBFC sector, Chola is probably one of the better buys.But you are promoting them to next level of the school. So, there is still an upside there. You can go out and lend again and make sure that you bring the next set of NPAs. You know the logic of public sector banks today needs to be examined very closely.You could assume that there was a time when you needed the banks to be more egalitarian and do some social lending and make sure that the penetration was far deeper. Today with private sector banks with a whole sort of small banks, midsized banks, special purpose banks, payment banks there is no particular need for penetration in terms of public sector banks having to carry their burden.More importantly if you continue to use them and to treat them like a regular bank and expect them to do the same things that a private sector bank would do, then there is absolutely no case to be made. So, either the government has to be clear that the public sector banks are carrying a social purpose and therefore you should not be applying the same logic or the same yardstick for measurement and therefore NPAs should be fine because if you are going to give money away to the farmers, for example, and do not expect it to be paid back, there is no point worrying about the NPAs or for that matter for the MSMEs.But if you are going to hold them to the same standard as private sector banks then you know the best thing to do would be to get rid a lot of them.\",\n          \"NEW DELHI: The government has started working out the possible post-lockdown scenarios and is considering another booster shot to minimize the impact of coronavirus and revive the economy but nothing has been finalised yet, senior officials said on Sunday.The focus is on issues that may come up after the lockdown is lifted on April 15, an official said.There have been discussions about a package but nothing has been finalised yet, the official said, adding that the idea is to revive consumption, \\\"so some measures might be needed.\\\"If a package is announced, it would be the third major initiative by the government to tackle the challenges thrown up by the rapid spread of coronavirus.On March 24, hours before Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared a countrywide lockdown, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a slew of relief measures for taxpayers and businesses.Two days later, Sitharaman announced a Rs 1.7-lakh-crore relief package for those hit hardest.On Sunday, the officials said they are also looking at the possibility of redesigning some welfare and other government schemes to suit the post-lockdown situation.Various options are on the table \\u2014 such as scholarships and fellowships given by ministries, harvesting of rabi crops and the government has started to address them one by one, they said.Out of the 10 empowered groups of senior bureaucrats constituted by the prime minister to prepare India's response to COVID-19, one group is tasked to suggest economic measures.An informal group of ministers, chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, is also looking into various aspects of the lockdown.\",\n          \"Neeraj Sharma\\n\\nThe Budget 2020 introduced Direct Tax Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme (\\u2018Scheme\\u2019) in an attempt to release INR 9.32 trillion (as at 30 November 2019) blocked in approximately 4.83 Lakhs appeals pending at various appellate levels. In its original avatar, the Scheme had 31 March 2020 as the deadline to opt for the Scheme. The Government seemingly intended to achieve the twin objectives of reducing the existing litigation and, at the same time, achieve its revenue targets for the year 2019-20 that appeared to be a distant one amidst the economic slowdown (before COVID-19 outbreak).\\n\\nIt is evident from the fact that while Hon\\u2019ble FM referred to the Scheme in her Budget speech on 1 February 2020, the Scheme got introduced in Parliament on 5 February 2020 itself. The Scheme was fast-tracked all the way up to 17 March 2020 when it received President\\u2019s assent after passing through various stages, including approval by Cabinet and of both houses of Parliament, issuance of FAQs, etc. The Scheme intended to collect the maximum revenue by 31 March 2020 and accordingly provided for payment of an additional 10% of the tax amount in cases where the payment was made after 31 March 2020.\\n\\nCOVID-19 Outbreak\\n\\nThe COVID-19 outbreak seems to have derailed the above plans. On 24 March 2020, while Hon\\u2019ble Prime Minister announced a nationwide lockdown for three weeks, the date of payment under the Scheme was extended to from 31 March to 30 June via an Ordinance promulgated on 24 March 2020, thereby enabling the taxpayers to make the payment after 31 March without having to pay additional 10% of the amount. The objectives of this extension are obvious. While on the one hand, it allows more time for the taxpayer to avail the Scheme; it keeps alive the Government\\u2019s hope of achieving the twin objectives of the Scheme, i.e. reducing litigation and collecting the revenue locked up in that litigation.\\n\\nTaxpayers\\u2019 Changing Priorities\\n\\nGlobal lockdowns have severely affected the liquidity of businesses and created huge uncertainty. However, with lockdown-3 in place in India till 17 May 2020, the priorities of the taxpayers seem to have shifted to survival. With no change in costs, while simultaneously clocking nil or very little revenue coupled with a delay in debtors\\u2019 collection or writing them off, the question for businesses is no longer to excel but to survive. In such hazy times, everyone wants to conserve cash as with the pandemic, and the future holds nothing but uncertainty. Therefore, businesses, which would have otherwise intended to settle their pending litigation by doling out some cash, are now willing to go for the traditional appellate route due to liquidity crunches and the settlement of disputes under the Scheme has taken a back seat. Moreover, whether the Scheme will become a priority or not in the future is unclear amidst uncertainties hovering around sustainability or survival of the businesses.\\n\\nPerseverance Measures\\n\\nThe Government is deliberating steps to keep the Scheme afloat such as \\u2013 a three months extension of the Scheme or giving an option to taxpayers for making payment in installments or staggering the payments further to the next financial year.\\n\\nWhat more could be done\\n\\nThe above steps, contemplated by the Government, are most welcome and highly commendable. The Government may also consider the following points at the drawing board while amending the Scheme:\\n\\nAdjustment against income tax refunds: At present, the Government is considering to release income tax refunds due to the taxpayers. Alternatively, the Government may pass the refund orders for several years\\u2019 along with interest due on such refunds. Thereafter, such a refund amount, inclusive of the interest amount, may be adjusted against the amount payable under the Scheme, for the taxpayers willing to opt for the Scheme. This will save the taxpayers from making payment of interest under the installment or staggered payment system and aid the Government in clearing its tax collection dues. While processing the refund orders, income tax returns of the taxpayers may be accepted as it is without making any adjustments on legal issues, else, it may create another level of rectification/ litigation and defeat the overall purpose of reduction in litigation and releasing the blockage of funds. Lower Interest Rate: In order to keep the Scheme attractive, the Government may consider keeping the interest rate lower. Presently, most of the defaults under the income tax statute carry interest of 1% or 1.5% pm (under COVID-19 relaxations, such interest rates are now @ 0.75% pm). To make the Scheme more attractive, interest rates may be kept at 0.5% pm. Interest rates may also be introduced for the levy on a progressive basis, say, no interest, if paid by a particular deadline, very low-interest rate if paid after the period but paid before a particular date. Similarly, a higher interest rates, if paid, even after such particular date. This would act as an incentive for the taxpayers to keep their funds reserved for settlement under the Scheme in their budgets. Relaxing the provision for treating declaration as void in case of default in payment: One of the major concerns that prevent the taxpayers to opt for the Scheme, even if they are otherwise willing to, is the fear of facing the consequences in the event of default. Present Scheme provides for treating the declaration as void and all the consequences under income tax statute to follow, if the payment is not made within the time prescribed in the order. The Government may consider relaxing such provisions under the Scheme. Extension of Appeal Pending Date: Under the present Scheme, appeals pending as at 31 January 2020 are eligible for settlement. With the above-proposed changes, the \\u2018appeal pending threshold date\\u2019 may be extended to either 31 March 2020 or 30 June 2020. This will ensure wider coverage of the Scheme not only for the Government but also enable the taxpayer to focus on business, which is the need of the hour. Providing revenue linked tax reliefs sector-wise or business size: Government may consider simultaneously introducing a scheme to provide relief in taxes for FY 2020-21 or subsequent years so that the businesses and economy could be brought back on track. Such relief in taxes may be designed not just for various sectors but also based on the size of the businesses i.e. differently for big corporations/ MSMEs/ smaller businesses. At the same time, the Government may defer the applicability of MAT provisions for some time as well or consider shrinking its base as well as lowering the MAT rate. Such savings in taxes not only rotates the cash back into the economy but also enable taxpayers to close the past litigations (with such savings in taxes) and focus on future business opportunities, who are presently considering to opt for the classic litigation route.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\n\\n\\nIn these tough times, the situation is not changing by the day, but by the hour. While the Government is proactively taking preventive as well as curative actions keeping the Scheme attractive enough, COVID-19 outbreak has created circumstances that Scheme has apparently lost its glamour for the taxpayers due to liquidity crunch and prevailing uncertainties. Unless some extraordinary relaxations are extended, the fate of scheme looks uncertain. Only time will tell whether Direct Tax Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme regains the center stage or remains in limbo as COVID-19 crisis looms.\\n\\nNeeraj Sharma is Senior Executive Director at Nexdigm (SKP Consulting).
